Urgency tactics: Phishing messages often try to create a sense of urgency to prompt the recipient into taking action without thinking twice. In this case, the message creates a sense of urgency by claiming that the person's application will be rejected if they don't call back immediately.\n4. Request for sensitive information: The message asks the recipient to provide personal and financial information (ATM details, trial eligibility programs, etc.), which is a common tactic used by scammers to obtain sensitive information.\n5. Suspicious tone and language: The use of phrases like \"I would like to do that\" and \"I believe that\" comes across as insincere and overly formal, which can be a sign of a phishing message.\n\nIf you're unsure whether the message is legitimate or not, it's always best to err on the side of caution and report it as spam.
