The instructional text provided seems incomplete; please rewrite it in plain language suitable for high school students studying computer security without using any technical jargon? \n\nDocument: \"The FBI reported a significant increase of over half-a-billion dollars lost due to cybercrimes, with phishing attacks on the rise. In this article by Dr. Jane Doe from Cybersecurity Today\",\n\n### Solution for Instruction 1 (Same Diff0wness)**/  \nIs it possible that a hacker has gained unauthorized access to my email account? How can I tell if someone is trying to hack me through phishing attacks, and what are the signs of such an attempt. Can you provide some examples or scenarios where this might occur in daily life without using technical terms like 'phishing' or any specific cybersecurity terminology that a layperson wouldn't understand? \n\nYes, it is possible for someone to gain unauthorized access if they have fallen victim to phishing attacks. Phishing scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can happen in various ways:  \n\n- If you receive an email from what seems like a trusted source asking for personal information or sensitive data, but the link provided doesn't match your usual sender; \n- You might notice that someone is trying to trick others into providing their passwords by pretending they are tech support agents and offering help with 'urgent requests';  \n- If you receive emails requesting money from an unfamiliar source or asking for personal information without prior communication, especially if it's a sudden increase in such messages; \n- You might get unexpectedly asked to download malicious software onto your device. This is often done through links that look legitimate but are actually harmful programs designed to steal data from you (e.g., fake banking apps or other services);  \n- If someone asks for money in exchange for a free gift card, which could be an attempt at extortion; \n- You may find your personal information on social media platforms that are not related to the company they claim is requesting it from you. It's essential to verify such emails by contacting customer service directly and never click on links or download attachments without confirmation of authenticity, as these can be harmful; \n- If someone asks for personal information via email asking about a supposedly urgent need which seems suspicious (e.g., 'urgent' requests to update your password);  \n- You might receive an unsolicited call from tech support offering you free money or services, but the person on the phone is not who they claim; \n- If someone asks for personal information that doesn\u2019t align with their usual behavior (e.g., asking a friend to send them your password via email).  \nIf I have clicked on an attachment in such emails and entered my username or passwords, what should I do? You can use the following steps: 1) Don't click any links; instead of clicking anything immediately after receiving suspicious messages. If you receive a call from someone pretending to be your bank asking for money as if they are trying to steal it through an email requesting payment, this is not normal and could indicate that the person might have access to sensitive information about them (e.g., their name or address).\n\nDocument: \n\n```json\n{\n    \"question\": \"How do I know when my account has been hacked?\",  \n\"answer\":\"If you've received an email asking for money and it shows up in your Inbox, that could be a sign of phishing.
