*PAR0:	so there's a very high turnover rate . 94985_96645
*PAR1:	yeah . 96795_97085
*PAR1:	so they [/] they say that a lot of people won't take it and stuff things like that . 97425_100245
*PAR1:	yeah . 100245_100445
*PAR1:	but that's what I'll be doing . 100445_101325

*PAR1:	trucks . 116885_117005
*PAR1:	well no . 117005_117325
*PAR1:	actually I would be getting it from the technicians not from the customers . 117565_120365
*PAR1:	yeah some customers I would because I would have to call them uhhuh . 120435_123365
*PAR1:	if I can't schedule them for a call . 123465_125165
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 125215_125565
*PAR1:	then I would have to be the one to call them and tell them okay . 125565_127725
*PAR1:	I'm sorry . 127785_128165
*PAR1:	not tonight . 128385_128925

*PAR1:	uhhuh . 133615_133965
*PAR1:	because I would be doing add-ons to them . 133965_135765
*PAR1:	oh and you know some technicians . 136105_137645
*PAR1:	maybe they've already been out on ten calls . 137645_139365
*PAR1:	and maybe it's seven o'clock at night huh already . 139365_141565
*PAR1:	and they've already been out there since seven o'clock in the morning . 141565_144045
*PAR1:	and . 144225_144445
*PAR0:	then you're telling them to go to more . 144445_145645
*PAR1:	places . 145645_145805
*PAR1:	yes . 145825_146045
*PAR1:	exactly . 146045_146325
*PAR1:	oh I see . 146705_147165
*PAR0:	mhm . 147345_147765
*PAR1:	so I'm gonna be chewed out by them . 147985_149245
*PAR1:	not by the customers per se . 149545_151205
*PAR1:	mhm . 151205_151565
*PAR0:	even though you're not even so how do you pick these people . 152035_155085

*PAR1:	yeah . 162515_162805
*PAR1:	and &-um I think they have a system where you know they would look at the technicians and exactly what the customer requested . 163065_170085
*PAR1:	what area they're in . 170155_171205
*PAR1:	mhm . 171205_171565
*PAR1:	and you have to find out what technicians work in that area . 171785_174405
*PAR1:	mhm . 174745_175165
*PAR1:	so and so forth . 175385_175965
*PAR0:	oh well if you got transferred right would [/] would that make it a lot more difficult for you to come up here and work here . 176545_182515
*PAR1:	yeah really well . 182665_184795
*PAR1:	okay . 184905_185195
*PAR1:	well first this is what I found out . 185195_186555
*PAR1:	first of all there's no openings over there . 186555_188595
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 188725_189075
*PAR1:	right now . 189125_189635
*PAR1:	the only openings they have is for telemarketing . 190655_192595
*PAR1:	that's it . 192595_192915
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 192925_193275
*PAR1:	no other openings . 193415_194155
*PAR1:	and . 194415_194635
*PAR0:	telemarketers get paid less . 194635_195875
*PAR1:	telemarketers get paid more . 196305_197915
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 198005_198355
*PAR1:	but I've already done that for a whole year . 198575_200395
*PAR1:	and I don't really like it . 200395_201275
*PAR0:	well if you're gonna get paid more and stuff you know . 202105_204115
*PAR1:	well I mean it's a it's from the pay that I get . 204385_207755
*PAR1:	now it would probably be a dollar more . 207755_209035
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 209165_209515
*PAR1:	each hour . 209665_210235
*PAR1:	yeah . 210345_210635
*PAR0:	that adds up . 210635_211235
*PAR0:	yeah . 211235_211475
*PAR1:	yeah . 211625_211915
*PAR1:	but I don't like it . 211935_212875
*PAR1:	I mean . 213155_213395
*PAR1:	see . 214695_214915
*PAR1:	okay . 215105_215395
*PAR1:	think about it . 215395_215995
*PAR1:	the assets that I get from working in Dispatch customer service and telemarketer . 216135_220715
*PAR1:	if I ever find a new job . 220855_222115
*PAR1:	mhm . 222175_222595
*PAR1:	I am gonna be better prepared than anybody who's ever been a telemarketer for two years or three years or whatever . 223395_230095
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 230185_230535
*PAR1:	I've had Dispatch I've had a you know I've had &-um a year of &-um clerical . 230845_237455
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 237625_237975
*PAR1:	and I've had a year telemarketing . 237975_239255
*PAR1:	I . 239295_239415
*PAR0:	think that . 239415_239695
*PAR0:	okay . 239695_239895
*PAR0:	well granted . 239895_240255
*PAR0:	well it may be easier for you to find a job . 240405_242855
*PAR0:	mhm . 242875_243295
*PAR0:	it may be harder for you to find a [/] a well-paying job because usually well-paying jobs demand specialization . 243475_249015
*PAR0:	mhm . 249315_249735
*PAR0:	in a field . 249955_250575
*PAR0:	mhm . 250915_251335
*PAR0:	do you understand . 251435_251975
*PAR0:	mhm . 252195_252615
*PAR0:	yeah like you know but like let's say you like I mean let's [/] let's take Mcdonald's <as a> [/] as a point . 253005_257615
*PAR0:	let's say <you've had> [/] you've had one of your experience flipping burgers . 257615_260735
*PAR0:	one of your experience using &-uh you know frying fries . 260735_264455
*PAR0:	right . 264465_264815
*PAR0:	and one of your experience as a cashier . 265115_267335
*PAR0:	okay . 267805_268095
*PAR0:	&-uh and [/] and of course if you go out to the job market you can probably find a job quick you know because you you're not specialized . 268555_275095
*PAR0:	let's say that there was a cashier's job that &-uh you know &-uh was paying a lot more . 275465_280655
*PAR0:	but they needed they wanted a lot of people with [/] with you know more experience . 281115_284695
*PAR0:	yeah hello . 285405_288815
*PAR1:	yeah . 289165_289455
*PAR1:	yeah . 289565_289855
*PAR1:	well I [/] I very much doubt that you can really compare me to a person that works at Mcdonald's who's no . 289855_295175
*PAR0:	I'm saying I'm using that as an example though you understand . 295355_297735
*PAR0:	there's different fields . 297735_298615
*PAR1:	yes . 298875_299095
*PAR1:	I know that . 299175_299455
*PAR0:	and Mcdonald's right . 299475_300495
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 300625_300975
*PAR0:	and so when you go out and try to find another job right &-um do you understand that it does . 300975_306295
*PAR0:	let's say . 306665_307095
*PAR0:	I mean let's say that it's a you know say it's Macy's then . 307335_309895
*PAR0:	okay . 309925_310215
*PAR0:	mhm . 310215_310495
*PAR0:	you know and then you have you know one cashiering job . 310595_313495
*PAR0:	one job in working inventory . 313675_315335
*PAR0:	you know like then the name doesn't really matter . 315755_317975
*PAR0:	okay . 318045_318335
*PAR0:	well my point is [/] is the &-uh experience . 318445_321255
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 321425_321775
*PAR0:	and . 322115_322335
*PAR1:	well that's what <I mean> [/] I mean . 322565_323815
*PAR0:	specialization . 323815_324655
*PAR1:	if [/] if I have specialization in three areas . 324835_327735
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 328225_328575
*PAR1:	compared to one . 329175_329855
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 330425_330775
*PAR1:	you know I have . 330955_331575
*PAR0:	would you call it specialized . 331625_332695
*PAR0:	you've only been there one year though . 332695_334055
*PAR1:	but you see three years all three but all three of them I have dealt with customer service . 335195_340095
*PAR1:	mhm . 340195_340615
*PAR1:	and <the fact that> [/] the fact that I've been able to [/] to &-um I've been very productive . 340715_346375
*PAR1:	mhm in those two areas so far . 346435_348375
*PAR1:	mhm . 348395_348815
*PAR1:	telemarketing I was very good at . 348925_350855
*PAR1:	mhm . 350955_351375
*PAR1:	I was always above a hundred percent so and so forth . 351775_356605
*PAR1:	clerical . 356645_357205
*PAR1:	I'm above my expectation too . 357545_358885
*PAR1:	oh I see . 359145_359645
*PAR1:	okay . 359755_360045
*PAR1:	so the fact that I am able to change over from one area to another . 360105_363365
*PAR1:	learn to adapt and do so . 363775_365405
*PAR1:	well . 365405_365605
*PAR1:	mhm I think that's a very good point in my area . 365605_368165
*PAR1:	oh uhhuh . 368305_368925
*PAR1:	okay . 369075_369365
*PAR1:	and if I transfer over to dispatch <which is> [/] which is a very high stress environment . 369365_373245
*PAR1:	if I'm able to do that and convert so easily and [/] and be able <to do> [/] to do well as far as productivity and getting people to cooperate with me . 373625_381725
*PAR1:	mhm . 381725_382045
*PAR1:	I mean that's far more experienced than anything else that I could have . 382565_386525
*PAR1:	I could imagine as far as telemarketing ever . 386845_388805
*PAR1:	you know if I stayed two or three years in telemarketing you know compared to being able to change from one place to another and adapt and everything . 388945_397165
*PAR1:	I think that's more important . 397285_398405
*PAR0:	well you [/] you understand then that if you take if you don't take account marketing job then you probably won't even come up here . 398795_405525
*PAR1:	yeah . 407285_407575
*PAR1:	yeah . 407965_408255
*PAR1:	probably . 408575_408735
*PAR1:	yeah . 409005_409295
*PAR0:	yeah . 409885_410175
*PAR0:	but you're gonna take it anyway . 410345_411485
*PAR1:	what . 412155_412445
*PAR0:	the dispatch . 413145_414405
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 414615_414965
*PAR1:	I [/] I requested it in fact . 415445_416845
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 416935_417285
*PAR1:	I am kind of I [/] I really don't like my the clerical job . 417725_421765
*PAR1:	mhm . 421825_422245
*PAR1:	because &-um of the people that I'm around . 422325_424165
*PAR1:	mhm &-um too many people I mean really I mean the supervisors there . 424345_428765
*PAR1:	okay . 429235_429525
*PAR1:	<we have> [/] we have one main supervisor and two assistant supervisors . 429525_434165
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 434175_434525
*PAR1:	well when the main supervisor is isn't there and the two assistant supervisors are there doing whatever . 434875_440245
*PAR1:	they [/] they fool around . 440715_442245
*PAR1:	they don't do a good job . 443185_444235
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 444485_444835
*PAR1:	and <I've already> [/] I've already went to the head person about this . 445015_448515

*PAR1:	well you see it might not be more stress to me . 623875_627165
*PAR1:	mhm . 627465_627885
*PAR1:	I mean what was stressing me out was the environment I was in . 628285_631005
*PAR1:	and that I mean that was every single day I . 631025_634565
*PAR0:	mean Dispatch is I [/] I mean you know I [/] I we read a little bit about it in Sociology and stuff . 634565_639445

*PAR1:	yeah . 644875_645165
*PAR1:	but if it's not and if I can handle it you know hey that's [/] that's fine . 645425_650165

*PAR1:	work isn't really what scares me . 657055_658545

*PAR1:	I know well you . 660785_661425
*PAR0:	know I mean like what I understand like you know right now it's like a . 661425_665185

*PAR1:	<the ethics> [/] the ethics around my workplace . 665945_668305
*PAR0:	no . 668805_669025
*PAR0:	but I'm [/] I'm saying I don't understand . 669025_670505
*PAR0:	it's like it's an awesome time for you to come up now . 670935_673225
*PAR0:	&-um because like around just the holidays people are moving out and stuff . 673565_676665
*PAR0:	so you can probably find a place . 676685_678105
*PAR0:	pretty good . 678105_678625
*PAR0:	mhm . 678805_679225
*PAR0:	and you know if you stayed within the same job environment . 679345_682505
*PAR0:	&-um I mean within the same department but transferred up here . 683125_685745
*PAR0:	mhm . 685745_686065
*PAR0:	you know chances are you probably won't get stuck working with the same kinds of people . 686145_689385
*PAR1:	that's true . 690805_691345
*PAR1:	but you know what I heard . 691485_692585
*PAR1:	I heard that the people over there are even worse . 693105_695185
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 695515_695865
*PAR0:	&-um how [/] how do they know that and stuff you know . 696885_698825
*PAR1:	because the [/] the supervisor that transferred over there told me that . 698975_703305
*PAR1:	&-uh and &-um she was telling me how hard it was at the very beginning because the people there aren't used to discipline . 703925_710985
*PAR1:	and they aren't used to really working . 711565_713605
*PAR1:	they [/] they . 713835_714525
*PAR1:	okay . 714795_715085
*PAR1:	the reason they had this [/] this supervisor transfer over there because this supervisor is known to be very [/] very strict . 715705_723545
*PAR1:	mhm okay very [/] very [/] very strict . 723645_726665
*PAR1:	and they want her to go over there to get the place together . 727365_730265
*PAR1:	mhm you know and it's I mean the people there are just from what I hear from her . 730565_735625
*PAR1:	and she's and I mean she is really &-um not a person to be doned or anything . 735685_742045
*PAR1:	but when she went over there she told me it was really bad . 742345_745565
*PAR1:	I mean people did whatever they want . 745685_746885
*PAR1:	hardly anybody there knew what they were supposed to do . 747625_750725
*PAR1:	mhm . 750865_751285
*PAR1:	I mean no one knew the system . 751725_753045
*PAR1:	nothing you know things like that . 753075_755485
*PAR1:	and then she had to retrain people and [/] and regroup people . 755545_758845
*PAR1:	and [/] and [/] and she says that she's still having problems now as it is . 759105_762125
*PAR1:	mhm . 762145_762565
*PAR1:	you know that there's a lot of people there who've worked there for a very long time and used to that environment . 762665_767005
*PAR1:	you already used to the fact that they could do whatever they want . 767545_770205
*PAR1:	blah [/] blah [/] blah . 770205_770925
*PAR1:	mhm things like that . 770925_772205
*PAR1:	and you know me I'm a very I am very by the book person . 772545_775645
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 776015_776365
*PAR1:	and &-um since working in clerical I've seen so much stuff that's been going around . 776665_780805
*PAR1:	and there have been people there who've worked for a very long time . 781545_784325
*PAR1:	mhm . 784465_784885
*PAR1:	and I you know I finally got fed up . 784965_786845
*PAR1:	and I told the boss you know certain things that [/] that were going on and so on . 786905_792685
*PAR1:	and so forth . 792685_793045
*PAR1:	and yeah you know I I've earned a lot of . 793105_796045
*PAR1:	I've actually probably made quite a bit of enemies you know . 796315_798645
*PAR1:	mhm . 798645_799005
*PAR1:	but to this point I really don't care if I make enemies . 799545_802685
*PAR1:	you know it's like I just as long as I'm doing my job . 802745_805645
*PAR1:	but they make my work really hard for me . 806265_808405
*PAR0:	you know . 809505_809805
*PAR1:	they have seniority . 810315_811285
*PAR0:	so if I didn't call then you how long would it taken you for you to you know like . 811745_815605
*PAR1:	what call to let you know . 815995_817125
*PAR0:	yeah I mean because you know I had I was really hoping for you to come up here now . 817395_820485
*PAR1:	well you see the thing is [/] is that I still don't know if I can or if I can't . 820595_824205
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 824415_824765
*PAR1:	my supervisor has been on vacation for two weeks now . 825025_828405
*PAR1:	and then late recently she just went on a seminar for a week . 828705_832325
*PAR1:	mhm . 832385_832805
*PAR1:	so I really haven't had a chance to talk to her . 833065_834925
*PAR1:	and I have to go by her book . 835385_837205
*PAR1:	mhm . 837505_837925
