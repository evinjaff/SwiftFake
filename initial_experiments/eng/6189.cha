*PAR0:	that voice . 2525_3135
*PAR1:	it's a very strange thing . 3485_4455
*PAR1:	so are we supposed to talk about something in particular . 4455_6255
*PAR0:	no . 6515_6735

*PAR0:	oh okay . 13515_13935

*PAR0:	huh . 19955_20175
*PAR0:	so they want the reason like . 20715_21855
*PAR1:	different regions of the country . 21855_22655
*PAR0:	yeah . 22845_23135
*PAR0:	well just like that's why I think they did it . 23135_24895
*PAR0:	like they want you to make a long distance call inside the United States to somebody else who speaks American English so that they get like lots of samples . 24895_31975
*PAR1:	wow . 32395_32615
*PAR1:	so they're gonna think my sample's like Seattle like the West Coast . 32615_35335
*PAR0:	well I think they don't they count they don't expect that everywhere you call is like . 37605_41695
*PAR0:	you know the person's gonna be from that place . 41755_44295

*PAR0:	well two classes are done . 68485_69615
*PAR0:	so cool . 69615_70135
*PAR0:	one class &-um was my three dimensional design class . 70435_72895
*PAR0:	mhm . 72955_73375
*PAR0:	and that like we didn't even have a project in that what . 74035_76575
*PAR1:	did you design . 76575_77135
*PAR1:	hmm . 77815_77895
*PAR1:	what didd you design . 77965_78775
*PAR0:	well first we made stuff with paper . 79245_80655
*PAR0:	and then we made stuff with sticks . 80675_81895
*PAR0:	huh . 82795_83015
*PAR0:	but it's actually harder than it sounds . 83195_84735
*PAR0:	okay . 85245_85535
*PAR1:	I'm gonna believe you on that one . 85915_86895
*PAR1:	yeah . 86965_87255
*PAR0:	you'd have to see this stuff . 87345_88215
*PAR0:	it's really neat . 88215_88735
*PAR0:	like I made a sphere . 88735_89535
*PAR0:	&-uh like first we make the first thing we have to do for the paper . 90235_92775
*PAR0:	one . 92795_93015
*PAR0:	he says . 93015_93335
*PAR0:	it's just make a square . 93335_94295
*PAR0:	yeah . 94645_94935
*PAR0:	and we have to do everything . 95035_96015
*PAR0:	has to be at a make a cube . 96015_97415
*PAR0:	I mean everything has to be out of one sheet of paper . 97535_99455
*PAR0:	yeah . 99685_99975
*PAR1:	you could do . 99975_100295
*PAR1:	we used to do that like in elementary school . 100295_101655
*PAR1:	like make those spheres . 102255_103295
*PAR1:	and make those like pyramids and stuff . 103295_104855
*PAR1:	yeah . 104965_105255
*PAR0:	except it actually was hard . 105555_107015
*PAR0:	like we had the guy . 107015_107895
*PAR0:	we got kind of complicated . 107915_109015
*PAR0:	and then &-um and then &-uh well it's probably . 109795_112335
*PAR1:	a fancier . 112535_113095
*PAR0:	square . 113095_113335
*PAR0:	yeah . 113605_113895
*PAR0:	then well the square wasn't complicated but like the things we did you know we went . 113925_116935
*PAR0:	yeah . 116965_117255
*PAR0:	of course he did like some really funky cool stuff . 117475_119335
*PAR0:	it made us all feel like idiots . 119335_120575
*PAR0:	but . 120575_120775
*PAR0:	well let's . 120805_121295
*PAR1:	see he's had a little more practice . 121295_122695
*PAR0:	yeah . 122725_123015
*PAR0:	and then the sticks . 123795_124655
*PAR0:	oh man . 124835_125295
*PAR0:	they were pain in the ass . 125295_126215
*PAR0:	they kept falling apart . 126215_126975
*PAR0:	and shit . 126975_127255
*PAR0:	they were like these little dowels like little tiny ones . 127255_130375
*PAR0:	and yeah we had to make shit out of them . 130375_132295
*PAR0:	and that was such a pain in the ass . 132355_135015
*PAR0:	I knocked . 135135_135535
*PAR0:	okay . 135765_136055
*PAR0:	I like first I started out doing this thing . 136175_137775
*PAR0:	and it became this really ugly looking bird house . 137775_139695
*PAR0:	and this one girl was like totally laughing at me . 139695_141495
*PAR0:	I was like . 141535_141855
*PAR0:	shut up pan sit up . 141855_142895
*PAR0:	and so then I started making something else . 143755_145615
*PAR0:	and I worked like two weeks on it . 146555_148775
*PAR0:	and it just wasn't turning out the way I wanted it to . 149355_152455
*PAR0:	mhm . 152515_152935
*PAR0:	so then I started doing something different to it . 153015_154495
*PAR0:	and I knocked it off the table . 154495_155535
*PAR0:	and it broke . 155535_156055
*PAR1:	no [/] no . 156635_157495
*PAR0:	I was like . 159135_159535
*PAR0:	this is not . 159535_160375
*PAR1:	not your class . 161315_161975
*PAR0:	so then I figured out something else to do . 162515_163975
*PAR0:	so I actually made things a couple like things . 163975_166135
*PAR0:	but that's cool . 166395_167455
*PAR0:	but then it but Dana was all worried because she had strep throat . 167755_170335
*PAR0:	so she missed like two weeks of class . 170395_172015
*PAR0:	oh no . 172155_172575
*PAR0:	and this class he said . 172875_174055
*PAR0:	because I was all like . 174975_175615
*PAR0:	how the hell do you grade . 175615_176415
*PAR0:	you know the first thing I ask I usually don't ask questions like that . 176435_179315
*PAR0:	but in an art class I'm like . 179335_180835
*PAR0:	how do you grade . 180895_181515
*PAR0:	and he's like . 182295_182915

*PAR1:	where do they work . 228885_229595
*PAR0:	I don't know . 230115_230555
*PAR0:	I guess they have more room because there's not students . 231235_233275

*PAR0:	he's like . 1039795_1040165
*PAR0:	I have to go to mom's on Friday after school . 1040165_1041685
*PAR0:	yeah I mean it's such a shame like I don't know what the hell she's saying to him . 1044215_1047305
*PAR0:	and Eugene is just an idiot . 1047305_1048665
*PAR0:	Eugene does not like never was as close with David as he was with Daniel and Jeanie's always like [/] like I said that to Jeanie and she was just like . 1049725_1057145
*PAR0:	well Daniel is she's like . 1057415_1059665
*PAR0:	well she does he does more with Dan with David now than he ever did with <than he> [/] than he does with Daniel now I'm like that's because Daniel's older . 1060255_1066465
*PAR0:	and he's like not around as much because he's out with his friends [/] friends . 1066565_1069280
*PAR0:	right . 1069415_1069765
*PAR0:	I'm like he took Daniel to Disney World and I was like . 1070105_1073685
*PAR0:	yes he did a lot of this stuff because Daniel was older . 1073705_1076125
*PAR0:	but on the other hand he never did anything to compensate for the fact that he was doing this with Daniel doing stuff with Daniel you know he never did anything to compensate to David right . 1076745_1085085
*PAR0:	okay you can't take him Disneyland but spend a whole day at the park with him exactly . 1085115_1088245
*PAR0:	and the thing is the one nice thing about Carol is I think she totally recognized that like when Daniel went to Disneyland with Eugene because Eugene had to go to a conference . 1088385_1096605
*PAR0:	right . 1096605_1096765
*PAR0:	that's why he couldn't protect David because David was too little to like sit quietly for the day during the conference . 1096765_1101365
*PAR0:	so Carol took him to David to Dutch Wonderland which is like you know for little . 1102025_1105685
*PAR0:	kids right . 1105885_1106525
*PAR0:	and I'm like . 1107105_1107645
*PAR0:	Eugene should have done that you know right . 1107665_1109485
*PAR0:	Eugene should have come back and taken David to Dutch Wonderland right . 1109485_1112725
*PAR0:	and like it's always been obvious . 1113105_1115085
*PAR0:	and David hits Dan Eugene all the time . 1115305_1118125
*PAR0:	and is always like kind of mean to him . 1118745_1120365
*PAR0:	hmm . 1121205_1121285
*PAR0:	and Eugene just kind of winds and goes . 1121505_1122965
*PAR0:	damn ain't doing my dad goes you know that's he sounds exactly the way he did when I used to hit him when we were little kids . 1123115_1129045
*PAR0:	really stop it . 1129625_1130765
*PAR0:	Andy because he does it . 1130955_1132005
*PAR0:	he goes to David he's like stop David and it's like his father . 1132005_1134805
*PAR0:	so I just poor David I feel so bad for him . 1136665_1138925
*PAR0:	he's such a nice kid . 1138925_1139645
*PAR0:	he's really bright . 1139645_1140645
*PAR0:	and he's just like I think the reason that like and see I try to tell stuff to Jeanie because I'm like hoping that she might catch on and try and do something in the situation . 1141745_1150805
*PAR0:	right . 1150805_1151125
*PAR0:	my mom's like . 1151185_1151765
*PAR0:	you can't be mad at Jeanie it's not her fault . 1151765_1153125
*PAR0:	I'm like I know but she's in she's closer to the situation than anybody else . 1153225_1156365
*PAR0:	and maybe she could do something you know right . 1156425_1157885
*PAR0:	and I like I said to Jeanie I think David is really affected badly by what goes on between his parents more than Daniel is because David's really a lot more sensitive than Daniel is . 1158025_1169445
*PAR0:	and she goes Daniel is becoming a very sensitive young man . 1169825_1172805
*PAR0:	and blah [/] blah [/] blah that's the point . 1172805_1174045
*PAR0:	and I'm like . 1174345_1174925
*PAR0:	I'm not talking about like sensitive like I'm a sensitive guy you know right . 1175945_1181245
*PAR0:	I'm talking about David is very sensitive to like his parents' emotions . 1181785_1185925
*PAR0:	and it really like he [/] he notices them or and cares about them a lot more . 1185985_1191245
*PAR0:	yeah it's not like . 1191755_1192725
*PAR0:	you're [/] you're trying to say that . 1192725_1194125
*PAR0:	Daniel's an insensitive group . 1194125_1195645
*PAR0:	I know I mean he's fourteen . 1196085_1197645
*PAR0:	okay . 1199435_1199725
*PAR0:	what's he doing . 1199725_1200245
*PAR0:	you know what I mean . 1200265_1200725
*PAR0:	and I'm just like . 1200725_1201405
*PAR0:	okay Jeanie like you're so useless . 1201635_1203525
*PAR0:	sometimes I mean what I mean I'm just like the poor [/] poor David like see Daniel's always had a real sense of humor about his mother's neuroses . 1203525_1211805
*PAR0:	yeah like even like I remember once at &-um we went over there for Hanukkah and we're like standing around waiting <and waiting for dinner> [/] and <waiting for dinner> [/] waiting for dinner . 1211915_1221445
*PAR0:	and Daniel was just like Daniel was like six years old . 1221745_1223885
*PAR0:	and he's just like . 1223885_1224445
*PAR0:	eh I have some more chips . 1224445_1225365
*PAR0:	it's gonna be a while you know . 1225365_1226525
*PAR0:	yeah . 1226525_1226805
*PAR0:	I don't know what the hell . 1227005_1227645
*PAR0:	he's doing . 1227645_1228045
*PAR0:	like I guess he didn't say . 1228195_1229485
*PAR0:	hell . 1229485_1229685
*PAR0:	but yeah . 1229685_1230445
*PAR0:	and but David is really sensitive like he totally tries to protect his mother's feelings . 1230625_1236125
*PAR0:	he totally like tries to watch out for her as well . 1236125_1238005
*PAR0:	well it's like she's been very attentive to him . 1238005_1239765
*PAR0:	yeah . 1239875_1240165
*PAR0:	so he's gonna cling on to her . 1240345_1241605
*PAR0:	and that's just the way it is . 1241665_1242685
*PAR0:	but it's like it's such a like . 1243305_1245365
*PAR0:	and so he's totally vulnerable to her craziness when she says crazy things to him . 1245585_1249925
*PAR0:	he totally is just like . 1250025_1251085
*PAR0:	boom he listens to what she says . 1251085_1252445
*PAR0:	because he's so worried about her feelings getting hurt . 1252685_1255045
*PAR0:	which I mean I'm sure she lays huge guilt trips on them . 1255375_1257805
*PAR1:	yeah . 1258875_1259165
*PAR1:	that's just bad . 1259165_1259605
*PAR1:	that's such a shame . 1259605_1260365
*PAR1:	that's just a bad scene . 1260745_1261765
*PAR0:	so I don't know . 1262065_1262965

*PAR1:	well yeah I mean there are pros and cons to both ways . 1267475_1270405

*PAR1:	and to be honest with you . 1346125_1347105

*PAR0:	nice . 1393225_1393515
*PAR1:	I could dig that . 1394955_1396435
*PAR1:	anyway so dad left U S D which means that since he's not working there there's no more U S C sponsored tuition remission right . 1396495_1403915
*PAR1:	which means there's an extra like some ten thousand or something dollars gap every year . 1404285_1408435
*PAR1:	right that somebody has to come up with the funds you know . 1408565_1412795
*PAR1:	mhm . 1412815_1413235
*PAR1:	it's like sack's not really having a heart to heart with dad . 1413315_1416115
*PAR1:	you know he just sort of expects dad to come up with the money . 1416695_1418635
*PAR1:	and part of that's fueled by mom who just you know assumes that dad should fund whatever Zach wants to do . 1418655_1425175
*PAR1:	and I and so you know and doctors assumes that dad will give him whatever he gave me for college . 1425315_1432855
*PAR0:	right . 1433025_1433375
*PAR1:	well I mean I actually discussed with my father . 1433845_1437755
*PAR1:	funding you worked with . 1437755_1439155
*PAR0:	you worked on your dad . 1439215_1440235
*PAR0:	I mean I remember you working on your dad . 1440355_1441835
*PAR0:	even senior year . 1441865_1442675
*PAR0:	you're like I had to call him to get some more . 1442675_1444555
*PAR1:	money . 1444555_1444755
*PAR1:	right . 1445205_1445555
*PAR1:	and but I like I [/] I put time into the relationship . 1446015_1449155
*PAR1:	right . 1449245_1449595
*PAR1:	you know I would call him . 1449595_1450875
*PAR1:	I would write him a letter . 1451035_1451875
*PAR1:	let him know what I was doing . 1451975_1452955
*PAR1:	I worked my butt off you know all every summer all through school you know right . 1453315_1458835
*PAR1:	and all the money I had that I could contribute . 1458835_1461155
*PAR1:	I contributed right in fact does have a work study job . 1461355_1464195
*PAR1:	and he does work during the summer . 1464495_1465635
*PAR1:	but I don't think he's necessarily saving all his money from the summer for school . 1466455_1469715
*PAR1:	mhm . 1469815_1470235
*PAR1:	and he like they had another settlement with my dad . 1470775_1476605
*PAR1:	mhm . 1476625_1477045
*PAR1:	and he used that money to buy a car like a few years ago . 1477225_1482065
*PAR0:	okay . 1482895_1483185
*PAR1:	like right before we went to college . 1483335_1484545

*PAR1:	okay let's see . 1485895_1487145

*PAR1:	geez you know and he like doesn't . 1491065_1492425
*PAR1:	yeah . 1492975_1493265
*PAR1:	Zach yeah there's like a lot of family members that are getting really fed up with my brother really . 1493535_1498225
*PAR1:	and I really can't blame them . 1498445_1499825
*PAR1:	mhm . 1499905_1500305
*PAR1:	because he's I mean he's always been very obnoxious . 1500385_1502385
*PAR1:	but he's just beginning to be more and more of a selfish prick . 1502645_1506465
*PAR0:	and just going over the line huh . 1507525_1508985
*PAR1:	I mean the thing is [/] is he's matured a bit in the last year . 1509025_1512785
*PAR1:	mhm . 1512805_1513225
*PAR1:	he sells a long way to go . 1513325_1514305
*PAR1:	but he just like assumes everything's gonna be handed to him . 1514965_1517105
*PAR1:	and like nothing's his fault . 1517105_1518505
*PAR1:	and you know he needs to take no responsibility for anything . 1519165_1522105
*PAR1:	right . 1522195_1522545
*PAR1:	and people are like . 1522965_1523665

*PAR1:	he's like this little prodigal son or something . 1530055_1531945

*PAR0:	she looked at both . 1570525_1571225
