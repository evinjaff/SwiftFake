*PAR0:	what was the last the &-uh remodeling or &-uh home project that you've worked on . 35_5165
*PAR1:	well let's see . 5955_6645
*PAR1:	&-um the last thing I worked on . 7225_10605
*PAR1:	well let's see . 11115_11805
*PAR1:	&-uh I haven't done an awful lot because I just bought my house here . 12265_15845
*PAR1:	oh &-um I've been planning on doing some work &-uh to &-uh fix up some of the stuff around here . 16065_23805
*PAR1:	and &-uh I've been repairing some lights &-uh stuff like that . 24465_28525
*PAR1:	&-uh need to I need to seal the &-uh back deck since it's &-uh they allowed it to get weather beaten . 29105_35925
*PAR1:	yeah . 36235_36525
*PAR0:	that sounds like a good job . 36525_37925
*PAR1:	yeah . 38435_38725
*PAR1:	well it it's &-uh it'll take a little while . 38795_42925
*PAR1:	but once it gets a little bit warmer I'll probably be going into it . 43025_46165
*PAR0:	yeah . 46395_46685
*PAR0:	it might even be enjoyable when the weather gets nice . 46685_48645
*PAR0:	mhm . 48745_49165
*PAR1:	yeah . 49715_50005
*PAR1:	the &-uh &-uh the house was kept in reasonably good repair by the people who [/] who I bought it from . 50305_56325
*PAR0:	that's good . 56465_57045
*PAR1:	and &-uh but <there's a> [/] there's a [/] a number of things to do . 57545_60525
*PAR1:	I also need to do some &-uh work with the &-uh &-uh heating and cooling system . 60645_66365
*PAR1:	mm . 66545_66765
*PAR1:	it doesn't &-uh get very good airflow to the upstairs . 67185_69645
*PAR1:	&-uh they didn't design it very well . 70305_72205
*PAR1:	so I have to put in some fans . 72225_73805
*PAR0:	is it an old house . 74265_75245
*PAR1:	no . 75865_76085
*PAR1:	actually it's [/] it's fairly new . 76365_77605
*PAR1:	oh &-uh it's just that they didn't there . 77745_79925
*PAR1:	there just isn't any airflow to the upstairs . 80055_82645
*PAR1:	mhm . 82645_82965
*PAR1:	because it's bad duct work design . 83045_84365
*PAR0:	I see . 84725_85005
*PAR1:	also and because of that they upped the &-uh fan rate to something to very [/] very high . 85315_91115
*PAR1:	which makes it noisy downstairs . 91115_92675
*PAR1:	mm . 92975_93195
*PAR1:	and wears out the bearings . 93415_94715
*PAR1:	I just had to replace the bearings last weekend . 94755_97355
*PAR1:	oh . 97615_97835
*PAR0:	boy . 97855_98075
*PAR1:	because I had no heat . 98265_99515
*PAR0:	well I have an old house . 100385_101395
*PAR0:	and I just put a I didn't do it myself . 101695_103795
*PAR0:	I had a new furnace put in just a couple months ago . 103915_106475
*PAR0:	mhm . 106535_106955
*PAR0:	and what [/] what they had here was an old gravity furnace that was converted into a forced stair gas furnace . 107255_113315
*PAR0:	yeah . 113345_113635
*PAR1:	I had one of those at my previous house . 113755_115595
*PAR0:	it [/] it just didn't keep the house warm at all . 115935_118115
*PAR0:	and the fan hardly blew any air through the house . 118115_120515
*PAR0:	so like you I have a [/] a [/] a stepped up fan motor now . 121135_124795
*PAR0:	and it's just incredible . 124795_125915
*PAR0:	the difference it makes with the new furnace . 125975_127755
*PAR0:	yeah . 127945_128235
*PAR1:	how fast is it running . 128455_129395
*PAR0:	&-uh you mean an RPM mhm . 130375_132115
*PAR0:	I have no idea to tell you the truth . 132635_134395
*PAR0:	there's four or five settings . 134395_136035
*PAR0:	and it's actually we had to turn it down to one of the lower settings because the [/] the higher setting didn't keep &-uh didn't let the furnace get hot enough to work efficiently . 136035_144955
*PAR0:	right . 144955_145235
*PAR0:	so the air wasn't all that hot . 145655_146795
*PAR0:	right . 147085_147435
*PAR0:	but it's on one of the lower settings which is still quite a bit more than what we had before . 147695_151835
*PAR1:	yeah . 151905_152195
*PAR1:	yeah . 152385_152675
*PAR1:	mine was turned up to &-uh fifteen hundred RPM .
*PAR1:	normal is more like you know seven or eight hundred . 152945_159155
*PAR0:	right &-uh . 159725_160395
*PAR1:	so it gets a lot of airflow downstairs . 160855_163075
*PAR1:	yeah . 163185_163475
*PAR1:	but &-uh still almost nothing upstairs . 163735_165595
*PAR1:	it's not that bad in the winter because the heat rises . 165825_168835
*PAR1:	sure . 169145_169435
*PAR1:	&-um but in the summer &-uh when it's time for air conditioning . 169615_173315
*PAR1:	yeah it won't be very [/] very effective . 173315_175995
*PAR0:	right . 176125_176475
*PAR0:	right . 176525_176875
*PAR0:	you have to have it then . 176875_177875
*PAR1:	yeah . 178345_178635
*PAR1:	have to figure out either some way to improve the ducting or to put a booster fan . 178745_183765
*PAR1:	going to the upstairs . 183765_184605
*PAR1:	mhm . 184705_185125
*PAR1:	&-um the bearings had on [/] on it had worn out to the point where it was rattling around rather badly . 185545_194245
*PAR1:	and finally just threw its belt off . 194905_196725
*PAR0:	oh boy . 197025_197565
*PAR1:	so &-uh . 197905_198605
*PAR0:	wakes you up in the middle of the night . 199375_200525
*PAR0:	that sort of thing . 200525_201085
*PAR0:	huh . 201105_201325
*PAR0:	yeah . 201355_201645
*PAR1:	well it's not that bad because I can't hear it upstairs . 201675_203885
*PAR1:	but &-uh that's good . 204185_205165
*PAR1:	the &-uh it it's it gets to the point where you can't hear the [/] the television or talk . 205305_210285
*PAR1:	yeah . 210795_211085
*PAR1:	or was getting to that point . 212185_213285
*PAR0:	not very peaceful . 213585_214405
*PAR1:	no it [/] it does the [/] the &-uh furnace does have enough &-uh &-uh heating and cooling power to [/] to so that the airflow isn't a problem . 214665_223965
*PAR1:	then I had the inspector check that out . 224435_227245
*PAR1:	and it was <cooling the> [/] cooling the air adequately . 227305_229965
*PAR1:	mhm . 229965_230325
*PAR1:	it was just it all the cooling was going downstairs . 230625_233285
*PAR1:	oh . 233705_233925
*PAR0:	well you don't need it . 234315_235285
*PAR1:	yeah . 236675_236965
*PAR1:	oh well the &-um I just repaired a light last weekend also . 237185_241765
*PAR1:	mhm . 241765_242125
*PAR1:	&-uh you know it [/] it has some hanging glass thing . 242465_245245
*PAR1:	panes around it with &-uh metal fringing in the metal fringing . 245775_249765
*PAR1:	it was like had &-uh bent away <from the> [/] from the glass . 249765_253845
*PAR1:	so glued it back together . 254505_255885
*PAR0:	oh okay . 256025_256805
*PAR1:	so it looks a lot better now . 257185_258765
*PAR0:	oh that's good . 259225_259925
*PAR0:	well the last major thing we did ourselves was we decided to refinish our bedroom . 260195_264285
*PAR0:	mhm . 264465_264885
*PAR0:	or to redo the bedroom . 264985_265845
*PAR0:	the downstairs has all natural wood trim . 265985_268285
*PAR0:	mhm . 268285_268685
*PAR0:	but the upstairs all the woodwork was painted . 268785_270405
*PAR0:	we decided we didn't like that . 270585_272325
*PAR0:	so we thought we'd get ambitious and strip all the paint off of the woodwork . 272905_275965
*PAR0:	and had I known what I was getting myself into . 275985_278085
*PAR0:	I don't think I would've chosen to do that . 278325_279805
*PAR1:	yeah . 280595_280885
*PAR0:	but we started it . 281305_282245
*PAR0:	so we finished it . 282245_283045
*PAR0:	and we also had to tear all this old wallpaper off the walls . 283045_286365
*PAR0:	mhm . 286705_287125
*PAR0:	&-uh and that was quite a mess . 287265_289005
*PAR0:	but yeah it it's nice . 289025_291085
*PAR0:	but we're a little disappointed because after getting all the wood off the paint off the wood upstairs we realized that it wasn't the same quality wood . 291105_297685
