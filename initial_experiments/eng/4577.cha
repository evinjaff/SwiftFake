*PAR0:	oh I see &-um I have some relatives that are in a Gospel singing group . 47905_51085
*PAR0:	and they do that . 51105_51765
*PAR0:	and it's just very time consuming . 51825_53685
*PAR0:	and I just dunno that I'd want to get into that . 54665_56645
*PAR0:	but &-um . 56825_57205

*PAR0:	because &-uh there's not it's not that easy . 66245_68005
*PAR1:	where do you wanna go to graduate school . 68255_69645
*PAR0:	I'm not really sure . 70105_70765
*PAR0:	I've thought about &-uh Southern Methodist University here in Texas yep . 70995_74885
*PAR0:	s m U . 75085_75445
*PAR1:	of course heard of it definitely . 75665_76805

*PAR0:	but they have a real good music program . 81705_83325
*PAR0:	and I I've thought about there . 83545_84965
*PAR0:	there's also Belmont University in Nashville uhhuh . 84965_88205
*PAR0:	Tennessee and that's Music City there you go . 88645_91805
*PAR0:	I would love to live there who . 92005_93365
*PAR1:	are some of your like inspirations . 93365_94765
*PAR0:	oh goodness . 95545_96045
*PAR0:	I listen to a lot of Contemporary Christian music . 96165_99165
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 99455_99805
*PAR0:	and &-um there's Larne Harris have you heard of him . 100065_102765
*PAR1:	no I haven't . 103105_103685
*PAR1:	he just to tell you the truth . 103825_105125
*PAR1:	I'm kind of weak . 105265_105845
*PAR1:	I work at a radio station . 105965_106885
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 106895_107245
*PAR1:	but &-uh I'm a little weak in that department . 107345_109165
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 109165_109445
*PAR1:	but the only one I guess I really know of without you know thinking even harder is Amy Grant because she crossed over . 109445_114965
*PAR0:	right [/] right . 115255_116085
*PAR1:	so yeah I know you know her stuff . 116145_117685
*PAR1:	I've seen a lot of her . 117715_118645
*PAR1:	you know before she went more pop . 118945_120645
*PAR1:	I've seen some of her original stuff and heard it . 120675_122565
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 122565_122805
*PAR1:	like on m t V and stuff like that . 122805_124285
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 124285_124565
*PAR1:	m t v but channels like M t V right . 125245_127565
*PAR0:	right . 127975_128325
*PAR0:	I like Amy Grant and Sandy Patty and Elle Harris and some of those . 128485_133125
*PAR0:	but &-um now I sing Opera because that's [/] that's what they teach you in college . 133465_137805
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 138055_138405
*PAR0:	is &-uh is opera for the technique . 138825_140925
*PAR0:	yeah . 141275_141565
*PAR0:	so that you'll learn how to sing and not ever hurt your voice . 141625_144405
*PAR1:	if you sing opera does that can that pretty much qualify you to sing anything else . 144745_148605
*PAR0:	right [/] right . 149255_150285
*PAR0:	I see the [/] the idea is that Opera is the hardest thing to learn how to sing . 150645_155165
*PAR0:	and if you can sing that then you can adjust your voice to sound country or rock or anything else . 155505_161485
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 161855_162205
*PAR0:	but you can't just because you can sing rock or country or something else . 162465_165805
*PAR0:	doesn't mean you can sing opera . 165805_167165
*PAR0:	because it's [/] <it's really> [/] it's really technical . 167515_170205
*PAR0:	and it's hard to learn . 170265_171245
*PAR1:	were you at &-uh you said you were at University of Texas . 171995_174485
*PAR0:	no . 175145_175365
*PAR0:	I right now I'm at a junior college . 175525_177125
*PAR0:	but I'll be transferring to Stephen F Austin State University . 177185_179965
*PAR1:	oh yeah . 180065_180405
*PAR1:	I've heard of that . 180405_180965

*PAR1:	yeah . 181555_181845
*PAR1:	yeah . 182035_182325
*PAR1:	I [/] I know of all these schools pretty much I guess &-uh through &-uh their [/] their athletics and stuff like that . 182405_187725
*PAR1:	right or their radio stations . 187725_189205
*PAR1:	because I have to deal with that a lot . 189445_190525
*PAR0:	right . 190775_191125
*PAR1:	so I don't know but yeah I've heard of Steven F Austin . 191905_194525
*PAR0:	oh they've got a real good basketball team right now . 194545_196605
*PAR0:	and they had a real good football team . 196665_198405
*PAR1:	oh that's good . 198865_199445
*PAR0:	a few years ago . 199765_200285
*PAR0:	that's good to know . 200285_200805
*PAR0:	we're supposed to talk about music though . 200805_202085

*PAR1:	oh . 221265_221485
*PAR0:	yeah . 221835_222125
*PAR1:	because you know I'm not I like most of the stations these days . 222125_224725
*PAR1:	all they do is play Classic rock . 224745_226205
*PAR1:	I mean if you don't like that I mean everyone likes some Classic rock . 226365_229245
