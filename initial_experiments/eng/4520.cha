*PAR0:	well I used to be a teacher . 235_1925
*PAR0:	mhm . 2705_3125
*PAR0:	and I think there are many things wrong with the public school system . 3665_6845
*PAR0:	and that's why I got out of teaching . 6905_8565
*PAR1:	well &-uh what were the problems that you found in &-uh public school systems . 9995_13125
*PAR0:	well &-um I think the main problem is there's just not enough discipline . 14075_19525
*PAR0:	and the classes are too big because &-um kids just get away with too much . 20425_30375
*PAR0:	and there's not really that much that a teacher can do . 30475_34055
*PAR0:	because &-um the administration is worried about the big problems about &-um you know kids bringing guns to school . 34205_45175
*PAR0:	yeah . 45765_46055
*PAR0:	and they don't have time to worry about the [/] the problems of [/] of management that they used to be able to worry about . 46595_53815
*PAR1:	well I think the problem is that if you start considering yourself more with discipline I think &-um I think teacher's main goal should be more instead of worried about discipline is getting students or you know kids interested in learning . 55045_68295
*PAR1:	because as I can recall when I went to go to school &-um most of the teachers were just basically bent on either trying to discipline you and then force you to go through this material and show no really interest I mean into making it interesting or fun [/] fun . 68295_85255
*PAR1:	and [/] and school were too oxymoron type of words . 85275_88095
*PAR1:	and I think that was basically the problem because they were more interested . 88715_92135
*PAR1:	they built up this type of &-um . 92135_93895
*PAR1:	I don't know this might not be in your case but at least where I went to school &-um a superiority complex where they had to be always more intelligent than their students . 94335_102575
*PAR1:	and it's impossible for students . 102635_103895
*PAR1:	they felt more intimidated . 104085_106175
*PAR1:	when &-um people would ask you know questions that they didn't understand themselves . 106565_110535
*PAR1:	so rather than doing this they would either you know ridicule the student or tell them to shut up or you know this is not what we're covering . 110675_117055
*PAR1:	we're doing this . 117055_117695
*PAR1:	and so certain kids who would be interested in exploring different avenues were just basically shunted because you know they were all more concerned that everybody falls along a certain path . 118115_127735
*PAR1:	although I agree that discipline is &-uh important . 128335_131895
*PAR1:	&-um especially since there are in different areas where kids have already grown to a point of rebellion or guns as you mentioned . 132595_142575
*PAR1:	but &-uh in general &-uh in certain areas I think if [/] if [/] if they started earlier maybe not in just the high school level but I mean elementary school maybe you have . 143155_151895
*PAR1:	to worry about switchblades instead of guns . 151895_154335
*PAR1:	&-um that the students would you know if the teachers got kids interested more into learning rather than bickering it'd eliminate these pseudo rebel rules that are created because you know if this teacher says . 154875_167575
*PAR1:	don't do this . 167575_168295
*PAR1:	and then kids do it . 168355_169295
*PAR1:	especially that age . 169295_170295
*PAR1:	they wanna be a rebel . 170565_172055
*PAR1:	so they're different . 172075_172935
*PAR1:	they prove themselves by you know &-um going against the establishment type of thing . 172965_178655
*PAR1:	what do you think . 179275_179885
*PAR0:	well I think the problem with that the problem I had . 181635_184765
*PAR0:	because when I went into teaching I decided I was just gonna be you know the perfect creative teacher . 184765_190925
*PAR0:	and &-um my kids were gonna just think that learning was fun . 191985_196005
*PAR1:	what grade . 197275_197725
*PAR1:	were you teaching . 197765_198325
*PAR0:	I was teaching eighth grade . 198725_199805
*PAR0:	oh . 200065_200285
*PAR1:	really the guns at that level too . 200285_202405
*PAR0:	yes . 202785_203005
*PAR1:	okay . 204635_204925
*PAR1:	this is in North Carolina . 205475_206605
*PAR0:	well this is in South Carolina okay . 207195_209205
*PAR0:	but anyway the problem that I had was &-um my students didn't really know how to respond to that . 210665_219525
*PAR0:	mhm . 219585_220005
*PAR0:	and they basically didn't they didn't appreciate everything I was trying to do for them because I would have learning games all the time . 221385_231965
*PAR0:	and I tried to do just fun things . 232425_234205
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 234535_234885
*PAR0:	and make it interesting . 235785_237205
*PAR0:	and do creative thinking and just all kinds of things . 237465_242485
*PAR0:	and they just took advantage of me . 243065_244885
*PAR0:	and they walked all over me . 244885_246125
*PAR0:	and I was never able to establish any kind of discipline because I started out being too nice . 246265_254405
*PAR1:	really . 254705_255125
*PAR1:	do you think the problem might have originated at an earlier stage . 255185_258245
*PAR1:	that maybe kids weren't really taught much to respect you know teachers and also try to do . 258715_263405
*PAR0:	well see that's the thing is I don't think that they do respect teachers . 263405_266285
*PAR0:	and I'm saying that [/] that [/] that . 266985_268885
*PAR0:	well just the administration and my school didn't give me any support . 268955_272325
*PAR0:	and it's like after you know the students were already taking advantage of me . 273545_278845
*PAR0:	&-um they just told me to just crack down . 280305_283045
*PAR0:	and then they wouldn't support me in that . 283505_285165
*PAR0:	and they just told me that the only way that these students would respond would be if I had a completely structured environment . 285865_293445
*PAR0:	and I was miserable doing that . 293545_296325
