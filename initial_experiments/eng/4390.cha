*PAR1:	well &-um currently I actually live in Virginia and Virginia does have the death penalty . 3795_8885
*PAR1:	but &-um obviously it has to be what we have to decide on whether is whether it's right for a certain crimes or not . 10425_17605
*PAR1:	mhm . 17665_18085
*PAR0:	mhm . 18185_18605
*PAR1:	&-um . 19305_19525
*PAR0:	well I [/] I think there are certain crimes that [/] that it's [/] it's definitely &-uh called for . 20235_24565
*PAR1:	such as like the &-uh murdering of a cop . 25275_27525
*PAR1:	or . 27545_27765
*PAR0:	well yeah along . 28515_29445
*PAR1:	those lines . 29445_29805
*PAR1:	yes . 29945_30165
*PAR0:	along [/] along definitely along those lines . 30255_32205
*PAR0:	&-uh I [/] I don't have any . 32425_33965
*PAR0:	I how don't I say this . 35085_37275
*PAR0:	&-uh I'm not interested in rehabil . 37575_40595
*PAR0:	in . 41735_41955
*PAR1:	rehabilitation . 41955_42355
*PAR1:	rehabilitation of . 42355_43235
*PAR1:	yeah . 43235_43475
*PAR0:	of certain of criminals that do certain things . 43655_45475
*PAR0:	and this . 45655_46155
*PAR1:	is true . 46155_46395
*PAR0:	you know things like &-uh like Jeffrey Dahmer you know right killing people and mutilating them and [/] and obviously doing very weird things . 47455_57495
*PAR0:	I don't have any . 57895_58415
*PAR0:	I don't have any problem . 58495_59215
*PAR0:	&-uh giving him the capital punishment [/] punishment at all . 59435_62655
*PAR0:	there's &-uh I think in [/] in a society you have to draw a line somewhere . 63725_67575
*PAR0:	and say . 67575_67935
*PAR0:	hey if you cross this line that's it . 67995_70255
*PAR1:	there's [/] there's [/] there's no chance of rehabilitation besides the fact of what rehabilitation actually costs . 70685_76375
*PAR1:	and the cost of keeping someone in jail on a life sentence as opposed to a death penalty . 76955_82095
*PAR1:	exactly . 82445_82935
*PAR1:	that's another thing to look at what [/] what the taxpayers have to pay . 83115_85615
*PAR1:	and the difference in cost . 85615_86735
*PAR1:	sure . 87205_87495
*PAR0:	sure . 87565_87855
*PAR0:	it costs every one of us to &-uh to support that person . 87955_90815
*PAR1:	right . 91305_91655
*PAR0:	you know . 92235_92575
*PAR0:	shoot . 92575_92855
*PAR0:	that's &-uh you may be locked up . 92855_94815
*PAR0:	but it's &-uh it's still room . 94835_96055
*PAR0:	and . 96055_96215
*PAR1:	board . 96215_96415
*PAR1:	right . 96415_96735
*PAR1:	we're basically paying for him to stay alive . 96735_98815
*PAR0:	exactly . 99085_99575
*PAR1:	exactly . 99765_100255
*PAR1:	and if you pull the general public who would want to keep him alive is another question . 100355_103535
*PAR0:	yeah I agree . 105285_106055
*PAR0:	now you know you can't go an eye for an eye I guess on every . 106115_109055
*PAR1:	every area . 109665_110135
*PAR1:	no . 110195_110415
*PAR1:	it doesn't work on every issue . 110415_111295
*PAR0:	no it has to be I think you have to define that &-uh fairly &-uh carefully so that you know it isn't a an abuse thing . 111875_121905
*PAR0:	but the one thing that &-uh that it ought to be is &-uh you ought to know exactly what's gonna happen . 121965_126905
*PAR0:	and there ought to be a timeframe for it to happen . 127005_128945
*PAR1:	a timeframe . 129745_130265
*PAR1:	how so well . 130265_131065
*PAR0:	in other words &-uh you put somebody on [/] on death row . 131165_134425
*PAR0:	and [/] and you can go on for ten or fifteen years . 134565_136545
*PAR0:	appealing everything . 136545_137185
*PAR1:	appealing it right . 137185_137865
*PAR0:	you know there [/] there ought to be . 137965_139345
*PAR0:	you know I'm not saying it ought to be like you know two weeks . 139605_142025
*PAR0:	and then you're gone . 142025_142625
*PAR0:	but &-uh there ought to be some sort of &-uh vehicle to &-uh make it a expeditious . 143325_149385
*PAR1:	I see I want continue along the lines of fair and speedy . 150065_154185
*PAR0:	yeah . 154695_154985
*PAR0:	exactly [/] exactly fair and speedy all the way down the line I guess . 154985_159025
*PAR0:	mhm . 159285_159705
*PAR0:	it's &-uh you know it's a tough thing to decide . 161615_164225
*PAR0:	but &-uh . 164445_164985
*PAR1:	so &-um I guess that would fall into the category of premeditated murder . 165525_169425
*PAR1:	what [/] what other crimes . 169425_170505
*PAR0:	goodness . 173665_173785
*PAR0:	&-uh I hadn't &-uh really thought much [/] much past that . 173965_177145
*PAR0:	&-uh you know something like bank fraud or something like that . 177285_180885
*PAR0:	certainly does not deserve . 180885_181885
*PAR1:	to no . 181885_182445
*PAR1:	white collar crime . 182445_183005
*PAR1:	doesn't exactly fall into it . 183005_184125
*PAR1:	no . 184225_184445
*PAR0:	no . 184585_184805
*PAR0:	you know when you get into things like child molestation and [/] and rape . 185985_189365
*PAR0:	now that's you know I'm not sure about that . 189545_192405
*PAR1:	right now . 193135_193925
*PAR0:	aggravated rape . 194245_194725
*PAR0:	&-uh would I would think would have to &-uh you'd have to consider that as <in the> [/] in the death penalty . 194905_200045
*PAR1:	right and rape . 200045_200725
*PAR1:	but rape cases are so hard to prove as . 200825_202925
*PAR0:	it is . 202925_203085
*PAR0:	yes . 203085_203205
*PAR0:	exactly [/] exactly . 203205_204165
*PAR0:	I mean it's almost &-uh one [/] one person's word against another . 205045_207885
*PAR1:	and [/] and <how can you> [/] how can you put someone's life up against that . 208345_210765
*PAR0:	yeah you you're [/] you're right about that . 211155_212765
*PAR0:	but when you get down to &-uh I guess what's in Texas called aggravated rape which is basically a brutal beating type [/] type &-uh attack . 212825_224805
*PAR0:	mhm . 224985_225405
*PAR0:	I don't know there . 227075_227635
*PAR0:	there's certain [/] certain aspects of that [/] that I would have to think would [/] would fall under that . 227635_233395
*PAR1:	what about &-uh methods of [/] of the death penalty . 234025_236915
*PAR1:	which [/] which are I guess . 237885_239595
*PAR0:	well in Texas we have lethal injection . 240105_241835
*PAR1:	okay . 242145_242435
*PAR1:	yeah . 242435_242675
*PAR1:	that's what they're doing here . 242675_243475
*PAR0:	and I think that's if you wanna call the preferred method . 243975_247355
*PAR0:	I don't . 247355_247635
*PAR1:	the preferred method . 247635_248235
*PAR1:	yeah . 248235_248515

*PAR1:	I don't know . 251755_252195
