*PAR1:	I you know told the students that they were going to you know what the new plan was . 118235_121635
*PAR1:	mhm . 121855_122275
*PAR1:	and &-um they're not that thrilled about it . 122355_125595
*PAR1:	but . 125695_125915
*PAR0:	&-um what do you mean . 126095_126875
*PAR0:	&-um that you're leaving that . 127335_128995
*PAR1:	I'm leaving that they're going to have to go into another class that's already going . 129055_133755
*PAR1:	mhm and &-um &-uh you know with a lot of other people . 133775_137795
*PAR1:	mhm and so they're not happy about that . 137975_140755
*PAR1:	mhm so &-um but anyway &-uh you know that's they don't have any choice . 140895_147355
*PAR1:	and mhm that's the way the program's gonna be . 147455_149395
*PAR1:	and they had a cake for me yesterday . 151095_153515
*PAR1:	mhm and I thought that was nice . 153615_155235
*PAR1:	they all signed the card and the whole thing . 155235_157315
*PAR1:	mhm . 157315_157715
*PAR1:	and &-um so I got &-uh I got one more week . 158055_161795
*PAR1:	mhm and that's it . 161935_163875
*PAR1:	so I'm really &-uh kind of excited about you know about <finishing up> [/] finishing up and going down there . 164095_173195
*PAR1:	mhm and I wanna &-um . 173215_176035
*PAR0:	I think you should move down there . 176715_177835
*PAR1:	&-um . 179185_179405
*PAR0:	I was thinking about it . 179885_180765
*PAR0:	if you're paying this woman money . 180785_182405
*PAR0:	plus you're paying your rent . 182515_183645
*PAR1:	yeah . 184395_184685
*PAR0:	it would be worth it to get an apartment down there . 184945_186765
*PAR0:	you're paying the same . 186765_187565
*PAR1:	yeah I <that would be> [/] that would be much easier . 188115_191765
*PAR1:	&-um the [/] &-um the [/] the only problem is that the [/] the rents there are [/] are really [/] really high . 192385_199325
*PAR1:	and &-um did . 200105_200845
*PAR0:	you look though . 200845_201325
*PAR0:	I mean I don't think they're I don't I know they're higher . 201485_204285
*PAR0:	they're probably a little bit higher than what you're paying now . 204315_207165
*PAR0:	but if you're paying that woman money to stay there and you're paying you know your rent . 207185_212605
*PAR0:	I'm sure you could find an apartment for the same amount of money . 212865_215125
*PAR1:	yeah I wanna be right in the town &-uh right in the city where I'm working . 215515_219965
*PAR1:	why [/] why . 220185_220925
*PAR1:	well oh well it's nice . 220995_222325
*PAR1:	I mean it [/] it it's a good place . 222605_223925
*PAR1:	but just to cut down <on the> [/] on the commuting . 224025_226525
*PAR1:	mhm . 226525_226845
*PAR1:	because if I am and I'm in the right place I'd only be like two or three miles from the job . 226925_231325
*PAR1:	mhm . 231325_231645
*PAR1:	that's what I would like . 231645_232365
*PAR1:	ideally that's what I would like . 232515_233925
*PAR1:	mhm . 234165_234565
*PAR1:	&-um <I when I> [/] when I start there's [/] there's somebody down there that's dealing that [/] that has that's into real estate . 235065_242405
*PAR1:	and I'm gonna ask . 242425_243245
*PAR1:	but I've been reading the paper . 243265_244525
*PAR1:	and &-um the &-um you know they [/] they want like close to a thousand dollars . 244865_250165
*PAR1:	mhm . 250425_250845
*PAR1:	so &-uh everything I noticed as I you know you go to the grocery store . 251105_256165
*PAR1:	you go to the gas station you know is a lot higher . 256165_259085
*PAR1:	mhm and &-um &-uh at least &-um what I was doing like for the summer is I was coming up and never buying gas down there but getting it here or &-um if I went to Long Island I'd get it there where it's [/] it's cheaper . 259105_272205
*PAR1:	and &-um and then I would &-um you know load up on my groceries and anything I was going to have I'd bring down there . 272985_279805
*PAR1:	so I kind of avoid it that way . 279905_281845
*PAR1:	mhm but &-um you know I [/] I that would be a whole lot easier . 281945_286965
*PAR1:	but then I don't know whenever I would get to see you and Mike &-um I wouldn't I'd be a lot closer to you right at that . 287105_297965
*PAR1:	and that part I'd like . 298105_299365
*PAR1:	but &-uh like for any you know any occasions anything &-um you know I &-uh I don't know . 299505_307005
*PAR1:	&-uh I [/] I just get the feeling . 308865_311645
*PAR1:	that &-uh that you would probably come up to this area . 311795_315125
*PAR1:	but not where I am is you know is &-uh often . 315865_319445
*PAR1:	so I . 320385_320845
*PAR0:	I don't know about that . 321685_322365
*PAR0:	I mean yeah I guess you know we have more friends and stuff there . 323605_326285
*PAR1:	yeah . 326835_327125
*PAR1:	and you but . 327265_328045
*PAR0:	you know . 328745_329085
*PAR1:	so I and then of course when Jill comes home like and she'll be &-uh coming home at Thanksgiving mhm . 330265_337405
*PAR1:	then everybody's gonna be congregating up here . 337515_340405
*PAR1:	mhm . 340465_340885
*PAR1:	so you know it's &-um it's a tough decision . 341105_345385
*PAR1:	but then &-uh as I was saying <on the> [/] on the other hand as soon as that that's . 345965_350465
*PAR0:	kind of a [/] a little bit ridiculous though to stay in you know one place for an you know for an occasion for Thanksgiving that comes around once a year . 350465_359165
*PAR0:	mm . 359585_359805
*PAR0:	you know I mean I don't . 360265_362205
*PAR1:	know <yeah I> [/] yeah I know it . 362205_365365
*PAR1:	so I I've I &-uh I I'm stuck here at least through &-uh through August mhm <because of> [/] because of least but even [/] even at that I'm [/] I'm not I'm stuck here but I'm tied in but I'm not if I wanted to leave I could do that . 365365_380045
*PAR1:	mhm . 380145_380565
*PAR1:	&-um I could just wait until somebody comes in and right and wants the place . 380825_384765
*PAR1:	and so I wouldn't be pressed to go . 384785_386205
*PAR1:	right . 386375_386725
*PAR1:	and then &-uh the other option that I was thinking of is after the &-um &-uh after the car is paid off to go &-uh move my stuff into Beman and use that as a primary residence . 387025_402205
*PAR1:	but yet but then like rent a room down there in the town I'm [/] I'm working in . 402225_407085
*PAR1:	so at least what I'll be paying is &-um a room which [/] which should be a lot cheaper . 407385_411965
*PAR1:	and [/] and &-um <I would be> [/] I would be just adding to the time . 412425_417645
*PAR1:	mhm . 417945_418365
*PAR1:	that I you know have to have residency before that thing is sold if it ever is . 418445_422805
*PAR1:	so &-um you know . 422945_424925
*PAR0:	but it's only three years . 425145_426125
*PAR0:	I mean . 426285_426525
*PAR0:	yeah . 426595_426885
*PAR1:	yeah . 427115_427405
*PAR1:	yeah . 427955_428245
*PAR1:	you have to be there three out of the last five years before selling or something like that . 428545_433205
*PAR1:	and &-uh hopefully Beekman will stay off my back as far as having renters . 433945_438045
*PAR1:	they don't want that . 438045_438805
*PAR1:	mhm . 438945_439365
*PAR1:	<they want> [/] they want &-uh them owner occupied . 439635_443085
*PAR1:	mhm . 443105_443525
*PAR1:	and &-uh so I'm kind of &-uh &-uh you know kind of fudging it for now . 443825_449965
*PAR1:	and they I told them a couple years ago that as soon as I &-uh found a job in that area . 450025_455765
*PAR1:	mhm . 455865_456285
*PAR1:	then I would come in there which you know really was [/] was my intention . 456365_460605
*PAR1:	so I'm just trying to I have to see how things go down here . 460865_465285
*PAR1:	and . 465425_465645
*PAR1:	mhm . 465645_465965
*PAR1:	what the possibilities are and [/] and stuff . 466045_468405
*PAR1:	but . 468865_469085
*PAR0:	well whatever . 470115_470765
*PAR0:	I mean it's your commute . 470885_471845
*PAR1:	yeah . 472195_472485
*PAR1:	yeah . 473035_473325
*PAR1:	oh well that's it . 473425_474445
*PAR1:	I'm I know I already I'm going to go down there <on the> [/] on the second . 474505_478325
*PAR1:	I'm gonna stay with her on the second . 478585_479965
*PAR1:	and &-um on the third &-um the next day I'm coming back here because then we have the &-um that Jewish holiday off in the middle of the week . 480705_489325
*PAR1:	mhm . 489345_489765
*PAR1:	yeah . 490315_490605
*PAR1:	do you get any . 491025_491645
*PAR1:	you don't get any of those . 491665_492525
*PAR1:	mhm . 492525_492925
*PAR1:	do you . 493145_493485
*PAR0:	no [/] no . 493785_495525
*PAR1:	so &-um yeah it's [/] <it's a> [/] it's a tough situation . 496025_500235
*PAR1:	the [/] the size of the place that I have here . 500575_502715
*PAR1:	mhm . 502935_503355
*PAR1:	&-um you know <with that> [/] with that triple dresser boy . 503615_508235
