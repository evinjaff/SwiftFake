*PAR0:	are you in New Jersey . 105_845
*PAR1:	I'm in northern New Jersey in Berkeley Heights . 1545_3485
*PAR0:	okay . 3715_4005
*PAR0:	yeah . 4005_4205
*PAR0:	I'm a little bit north of you in Morristown oh . 4225_6485
*PAR1:	really . 6485_6725
*PAR1:	yeah . 6875_7165
*PAR1:	yeah . 7275_7565
*PAR1:	wow . 9365_9585
*PAR0:	so in general how do you feel . 10005_11385
*PAR1:	well I feel my real estate taxes are exorbitant . 12375_15065
*PAR1:	mhm . 15065_15385
*PAR1:	and &-uh I think a lot of that is due to &-uh school taxes . 16005_19665
*PAR1:	&-uh from what I understand New Jersey has the &-uh highest education cost per pupil &-uh over the entire United States I think even including Alaska where you might expect cost to be higher . 20925_32495
*PAR1:	mm . 32755_32975
*PAR1:	and I'm not exactly sure what that can be attributed to . 34365_37225
*PAR1:	I think it's a lot of it is &-um &-uh administrative costs because &-uh teachers don't really get paid any more than &-um other you know states in the Northeast yeah . 37265_50545
*PAR1:	but I think the administrators I think we're overloaded with administrators . 50725_53665
*PAR1:	so I think education costs are really one of the big expenses in New Jersey . 54165_58445
*PAR0:	and yeah we just voted on our &-uh school board budget . 58505_61005
*PAR0:	yesterday . 61005_61565
*PAR0:	&-uh it passed it had a two percent increase . 62025_64445
*PAR0:	yeah . 64595_64885
*PAR0:	which was &-uh you know pretty modest . 64975_66565
*PAR0:	&-um compared to the &-uh municipal budget that went up eleven percent . 67145_71565
*PAR0:	oh really no increase in services . 71745_73405
*PAR0:	so yeah . 73585_74165
*PAR0:	school board is doing a little bit better job this year than &-um the Township administration . 74265_79205
*PAR1:	yeah . 79355_79645
*PAR1:	I [/] I think that's true . 79725_80565
*PAR1:	I think the &-uh they have stabilized the &-um the school board costs . 80765_84845
*PAR1:	&-um our municipal costs have stabilized too . 85385_88165
*PAR1:	but I think they're just enormous to start out from . 88185_90165
*PAR1:	hmm . 90485_90565
*PAR0:	yeah . 91155_91445
*PAR0:	&-um we have &-um one of the highest I'm in the Morris School district . 91665_96365
*PAR0:	and we have about seventy five hundred dollars per pupil expenditure . 96785_100205
*PAR0:	which is I think &-uh about two thousand dollars more per pupil than the state average . 100205_105805
*PAR0:	really . 106065_106485
*PAR0:	&-um but &-uh I have several friends in school business administration . 106705_112645
*PAR0:	and they all you know tell me that &-uh that seventy five hundred is not outta line considering the size of the district and the diversity of the population and the richness of the programs and everything . 112705_122125
*PAR0:	mm . 122305_122525
*PAR0:	in fact one in particular is &-uh was the business administrator for Randolph District which was listed by one of the &-um by Magazine as one of the top districts in the country . 122825_132765
*PAR0:	and &-um but he chose to live in Moore School districts so he could have his child go there . 133745_138125
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 138525_138845
*PAR0:	so that was a pretty [/] pretty strong boat in favor . 139025_141005
*PAR0:	yeah . 141195_141485
*PAR1:	well I . 141755_142125
*PAR0:	have nothing at least that portion of our money . 142125_143645
*PAR1:	right . 143815_144165
*PAR1:	the quality education I think is [/] is reasonably good . 144185_146485
*PAR1:	I just think we're paying too much for it . 146605_148005
*PAR1:	my wife happens to be a &-um a learning disabilities consultant . 148345_152725
*PAR1:	mhm . 152825_153245
*PAR1:	and &-um I give her a lot of grief because it's [/] it's one of these programs that are mandated by the state . 153985_160405
*PAR1:	mhm . 160425_160845
*PAR1:	&-uh she does no teaching . 161385_162845
*PAR1:	she &-uh does a lot of paperwork and trying to screen pupils who need extra help . 162985_167645
*PAR1:	mhm . 167665_168085
*PAR1:	and it's [/] it's very labor intensive and a lot of paperwork . 168945_172085
*PAR1:	and I [/] I [/] I often wonder whether we're [/] we're really getting our money's worth for helping these students . 172145_179405
*PAR1:	I think they have to be helped in some way . 179685_181125
*PAR1:	but I'm [/] I'm just wondering whether the process is really efficient . 181145_184245
*PAR1:	and that's just one of the kinds of &-uh services that we're really paying for . 184245_188325
*PAR0:	yeah that's [/] that's part of the frustrating &-uh areas of [/] of this topic is &-uh I don't have a whole lot of problem with the total amount of tax I pay . 188755_198445
*PAR0:	and I have no idea what that is . 198785_200365
*PAR0:	by the way as I'm sitting here thinking about it I have no idea . 201225_204445
*PAR0:	I don't know whether I end up paying thirty percent or fifty percent of my total wages and taxes . 204565_210685
*PAR0:	<when you> [/] when you think of income and social security and state tax and [/] and local tax and then sales tax . 210875_219125
*PAR0:	&-uh I suspect it's &-uh you know pretty [/] pretty high up there . 219865_223085
*PAR0:	forty fifty percent . 223085_224045
*PAR0:	I'm sure it's but I mean my standard of living is high . 224305_227125
*PAR0:	and I &-uh you know I get police protection and garbage pickup . 227125_230005
*PAR0:	and you know what else do I need . 230145_231365
*PAR0:	&-uh what I don't know though is if that tax money is being spent efficiently and effectively . 232065_236885
*PAR0:	&-uh and I'm [/] I'm sure as in any business things could improve . 237665_242045
*PAR0:	but I don't know overall whether &-uh I'm getting full value for that &-uh tax dollar . 242425_248005
*PAR0:	&-um I [/] I just I don't have any way of [/] of really determining that unless you get into the nitty gritty of a budget and see where every dollar goes . 248695_258355
*PAR0:	right . 258405_258755
*PAR1:	well [/] well lay people . 258755_259475
*PAR0:	how are you gonna know . 259495_259955
*PAR1:	and we really don't know . 260295_261195
*PAR1:	and I think &-um school boards &-um sort of have inertia too . 261495_266595
*PAR1:	they [/] they accept what's given to them too . 266595_268435
*PAR1:	but they're experts . 268575_269555
*PAR1:	they're administrators . 269705_270835
*PAR1:	and just pass it on . 270855_271955
*PAR1:	I mean I don't think anyone's really gone into depth to try to &-uh suggest what can be done to make it more . 272395_278155
*PAR0:	efficient . 278355_278555
*PAR0:	yeah . 278745_279035
*PAR0:	just [/] just &-uh you know a couple of almost anecdotal things . 279105_284335
*PAR0:	I know New Jersey has more school districts than any other state . 284575_287735
*PAR0:	which is incredible . 289315_290305
*PAR0:	given our size . 290305_291185
*PAR0:	mhm . 291205_291625
*PAR0:	not only the population but the density and [/] and the territory . 291885_295545
*PAR0:	but we have more school districts than any other . 295965_298265
