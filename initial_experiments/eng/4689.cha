*PAR0:	how about you . 2185_2765
*PAR1:	&-uh we have six . 3265_4205
*PAR0:	oh you've got a good household then . 4545_5805
*PAR1:	yes we do . 5905_6525
*PAR1:	and it &-uh it's &-um actually a very time consuming business raising children . 6625_12435
*PAR0:	I would Ima well yeah it is I know . 12995_14795
*PAR0:	&-um you're able to stay home with them . 14975_17155
*PAR0:	yes . 17375_17595
*PAR1:	I am which &-uh I don't know how people with big families are able to do anything . 17795_21875
*PAR1:	but I mean if they have to work I don't know how they keep tag of their children . 21975_25875
*PAR0:	I don't either . 26635_27115
*PAR0:	my wife gets to stay home . 27295_28555
*PAR0:	and &-uh I think it's a good thing . 28855_30515
*PAR0:	so &-uh she gets to spend well most the day you know there's always things that come up . 30695_36955
*PAR0:	but with [/] with few exceptions he's she's there when she needs them . 37015_42395
*PAR0:	mhm . 42535_42955
*PAR0:	or when they need them . 43335_44235
*PAR0:	and &-uh right there I have two little girls . 44575_47315
*PAR0:	one's four . 47645_48195
*PAR0:	and &-uh the other is two in a couple weeks . 49255_52195
*PAR0:	and &-uh my time with them is not what I'd like it to be . 53855_58435
*PAR0:	actually I get to spend . 58675_59475
*PAR0:	well every night I read to them . 60535_61825
*PAR0:	they like that . 61895_62625
*PAR0:	and that takes about half an hour . 62925_64345
*PAR0:	and that's probably what I would consider the best time that I have with them . 64405_68465
*PAR1:	well and from what you've &-um what I read in here . 68935_71385
*PAR1:	that's probably the best one of the best things you can do with your children . 71385_75665
*PAR0:	time . 75975_76265
*PAR0:	well they like it . 76265_76825
*PAR0:	you know take time . 76925_77705
*PAR0:	that's the way we settle them down and get them into bed . 77705_79865
*PAR0:	and &-uh mhm . 80085_80825
*PAR1:	and they probably look forward to that every night . 80925_82585
*PAR1:	I know my children were the same way . 83985_85585
*PAR1:	mine are quite a bit older . 85735_86745
*PAR1:	a lot of them . 87305_87745
*PAR1:	I have a senior . 88705_89265
*PAR1:	and [/] and he's the oldest . 90525_92025
*PAR1:	and then my youngest was as a first grader this year . 92085_94865
*PAR1:	and the little girls which are my two youngest . 95565_97425
*PAR1:	they really like to spend that time just before bed being read to and having &-uh having that personal time with parents when nobody else interfering . 97495_108755
*PAR1:	and when you have a large family that's kind of hard to spend that individual time with each child . 110055_114275
*PAR1:	but it's &-um it's something I remember when I was young . 114535_120955
*PAR1:	that's the times I remember the best or when my parents were with me just before I went to bed at night . 121975_127075
*PAR1:	mhm . 127255_127675
*PAR1:	singing songs and reading stories and sometimes just talking . 128545_133235
*PAR1:	but I remember those times the best . 133335_134995
*PAR1:	so I think that's an important thing to do if you're on the right track . 135135_139835
*PAR0:	well she likes it . 140465_141595
*PAR0:	and [/] and she knows that it's important . 141595_143155
*PAR0:	us . 143295_143515
*PAR0:	in fact my four year old is [/] is now reading along with us . 143575_146315
*PAR0:	oh so and [/] and that's because you know we've been able to spend the time . 146655_150795
*PAR0:	and [/] and she has found that it's enjoyable . 150895_153955
*PAR0:	so now we kind of trade off . 154095_156475
*PAR0:	I read to her . 156555_157115
*PAR0:	and she reads to me . 157115_157995
*PAR1:	which is read the same story long enough . 159605_161115
*PAR1:	they even can memorize it . 161115_162595
*PAR0:	well actually she [/] she can pick up a book . 163345_165475
*PAR0:	now that's brand new . 165475_166515
*PAR0:	and &-uh they even pick . 166815_167915
*PAR1:	out the . 167915_168115
*PAR0:	word read along . 168115_169115
*PAR1:	that's really &-uh . 170335_171235
*PAR0:	she's &-uh pretty remarkable that way . 171405_173115
*PAR1:	that's a good accomplishment . 173255_174475
*PAR1:	for a four year old . 174495_175315
*PAR1:	a lot of children don't learn how to read until they get into school . 175355_177715
*PAR0:	but &-uh our two year old she knows her alphabet . 178095_182645
*PAR0:	so you know it starts pretty early I think . 182745_184805
*PAR0:	because that's the books that she likes . 185885_187325
*PAR0:	she likes lists of things . 187325_188405
*PAR0:	mhm . 188505_188925
*PAR0:	but &-uh other than that you know in terms of family time we spend &-uh oh you know dinner time . 190585_198635
*PAR0:	and &-uh I'll sometimes come back to work and then go back for their bedtime . 199215_203155
*PAR0:	and then usually I'm around weekends . 203895_206595
*PAR0:	mhm . 206855_207275
*PAR0:	&-um so I [/] I think they're not suffering too badly . 208095_213165
*PAR1:	well I always felt like as long as one parent was home with him the majority of the time . 214435_219665
*PAR0:	yeah . 220335_220625
*PAR1:	the other parent can fill in <when he> [/] when he or she can . 221005_225635
*PAR1:	and [/] and have some good quality time with him . 225775_228475
*PAR1:	and <it's still> [/] it's still . 228495_230075
*PAR1:	okay . 230145_230435
*PAR1:	it's the children that come home to empty houses that worry me . 230745_233315
*PAR0:	yeah . 234345_234635
*PAR0:	because then you know they're not getting any instruction except from the tv . 234635_237955
*PAR0:	that's . 238535_238955
*PAR1:	right . 238955_239075
*PAR0:	which is not the place to get it . 239125_240515
*PAR1:	and you wonder I just know what happens when my children get home from school . 240895_245075
*PAR1:	and if I wasn't here I would miss out on so many important things that I hear <when they> [/] when they first come home . 245615_252515
*PAR1:	mhm . 252515_252915
*PAR1:	and &-uh I drive up the road after school . 253655_255995
*PAR1:	sometimes I take my children to lesson's piano or whatever . 255995_258715
*PAR1:	and I see several households where the children come home . 258775_262665
*PAR1:	and there's no one there . 262685_263585
*PAR1:	and they just all kind of pack out together you know and run the neighborhood . 264575_268115
*PAR1:	and until the parents come home a couple of hours later . 268215_271395
*PAR1:	and I just think you know I I'm I am really [/] really glad that that's not what happens at my house because &-uh I kind of think that's where the [/] the problems are coming from . 271535_283175
*PAR0:	a lot of them especially in [/] in like the cities where there are lots and lots of kids and lots of pressure to for parents to go out and work . 283695_290215
*PAR1:	it does &-uh it [/] it is I think &-uh part of the problems of what the youth are going through today . 291825_299085
*PAR1:	mhm . 299085_299485
