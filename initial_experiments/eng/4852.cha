*PAR0:	mhm and &-uh he said . 1555145_1556565
*PAR0:	okay well then you probably need to speak to someone at Harvard to just go right . 1556675_1560485
*PAR0:	and I'd rather do that . 1560625_1561565
*PAR0:	I don't wanna talk to the doctors . 1561645_1562645
*PAR0:	right . 1562895_1563245

*PAR0:	they really weren't very forthcoming with [/] with anything . 1595605_1598245
*PAR0:	and I said . 1598265_1598765
*PAR0:	it's very unusual that you have doctors go against their own colleagues . 1598765_1601965
*PAR0:	right . 1602095_1602445
*PAR0:	I said . 1602645_1602925
