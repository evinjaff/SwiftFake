*PAR0:	&-uh . 65585_65805
*PAR1:	since we got married about ten years ago . 65855_67365
*PAR0:	oh really . 67625_68045
*PAR0:	mhm . 68065_68485
*PAR0:	I tried it once . 69365_70045
*PAR0:	but it just didn't seem . 70065_71085
*PAR0:	I mean it was pretty depressing some months . 71285_73405
*PAR0:	it looked like . 73505_74125
*PAR0:	I mean I'd have a negative when I compared how much money we had coming in to how much money we had going out . 74525_79325
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 79455_79805
*PAR0:	I mean I know theoretically how that happens . 80045_82005
*PAR0:	but it would turn out to be like . 82185_83805
*PAR0:	there would be negatives . 83805_84965
*PAR0:	and it got pretty depressing . 84965_86285
*PAR0:	well . 86715_87005
*PAR1:	we budget our [/] our purchases . 87005_88525
*PAR1:	like if we're gonna buy a refrigerator for example . 88525_90405
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 90575_90925
*PAR1:	and . 91025_91245
*PAR0:	we had . 91245_91485
*PAR1:	take a loan for that . 91485_92245
*PAR1:	then deciding how quick I wanted to pay it off or what I could afford . 92835_96845
*PAR1:	I'd double the payment . 97025_97885
*PAR1:	yeah . 98155_98445
*PAR1:	and maybe pay it off in a year or six months . 98665_100685
*PAR1:	yeah . 100995_101285
*PAR1:	and so I would figure out . 101625_102885
*PAR1:	and that's the only way we've been able to buy big items . 103025_106005
*PAR1:	hmm . 106845_106925
*PAR1:	it seems like you know we need furniture . 107385_109445
*PAR1:	then you know a bedroom seat . 109445_110685
*PAR1:	then we need to budget it . 110685_112085
*PAR1:	yeah . 112395_112685
*PAR1:	and then you know meet the most payment that we can meet . 113025_115845
*PAR1:	and yet still do . 116425_117365
*PAR1:	okay . 117475_117765
*PAR0:	hmm . 118685_118765
*PAR0:	and it's worked out for you . 118825_119885
*PAR0:	how many large things have you bought that way . 119885_121805
*PAR1:	&-uh everything . 122105_122765
*PAR1:	oh really . 122985_123445
*PAR0:	mhm . 123465_123885
*PAR1:	one step at a time . 124505_125445
*PAR0:	we've been kind of hit and miss I guess . 125775_127885
*PAR0:	and we know when we have a bill that's fixing to be &-um paid off that we'll have this extra amount coming in . 128105_135285
*PAR0:	and of course something else will come along . 135285_136925
*PAR0:	mhm . 137025_137445
*PAR0:	we do get loans . 137665_138525
*PAR0:	and we do basically the same thing . 138745_141005
*PAR0:	but we I don't put it on paper . 141065_142605
*PAR0:	I just I'm I I'm very financially equipped mentally you know I mean . 142885_149365
*PAR0:	mhm . 149485_149805
*PAR0:	I know how to do these things . 149925_150845
*PAR0:	and I can sit down and write it out . 150905_152165
*PAR0:	but it just doesn't seem to work out for us . 152165_154045
*PAR1:	well I write it out every time . 154355_156205
*PAR1:	and I might sometimes even do it a paycheck . 156465_158325
*PAR1:	ahead . 158335_158685
*PAR0:	oh yeah just . 159025_159725
*PAR1:	to figure out next time in the next two weeks what I'll have left over . 159725_163285
*PAR1:	and then how I can use that money . 163385_164725
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 164975_165325
*PAR1:	according to what we need . 165435_166965
*PAR1:	I'm not gonna tell you . 168405_169065
*PAR1:	we're not maxed out . 169065_169985
*PAR1:	because being in college I am I mean you know we're living <at a> [/] at a rate that we're just barely getting by . 170225_175945
*PAR1:	yeah . 175975_176265
*PAR1:	until I graduate and then we'll be able to double our income . 176435_178905
*PAR1:	yeah . 179115_179405
*PAR0:	that'll be great . 179405_180045
*PAR0:	when you do . 180045_180525
*PAR0:	my sister just graduated from medical college . 180585_182645
*PAR0:	so I know that'll [/] that'll be great for you . 182785_184925
*PAR1:	I'm looking forward to . 185385_186205
*PAR0:	it I bet . 186205_187005
*PAR1:	but &-uh even in that way we figured if we just turn all my paychecks over . 187705_191685
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 191895_192245
*PAR1:	and budget it into the bills we'll have every bill including our car and truck paid off in like four months . 192245_197485
*PAR0:	Gosh . 197995_198285
*PAR1:	you know so that's kind of what we're looking at . 199145_201605
*PAR1:	yeah . 201875_202165
*PAR1:	now that's not including student loans . 202665_204285
*PAR0:	right [/] right . 204815_205605
*PAR1:	but those loans are so much cheaper . 205985_207885
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 208175_208525
*PAR1:	budget wise . 208525_209085
*PAR1:	they're smart to keep those to last . 209085_210605
*PAR0:	yeah . 210835_211125
*PAR0:	they're [/] they're financed at pretty low interest rate most of the time . 211125_213445
*PAR0:	aren't they . 213445_213845
*PAR1:	they certainly are . 213875_214645
*PAR1:	yeah . 214795_215085
*PAR1:	seven or eight percent . 215085_215965
*PAR0:	that's a good deal . 216105_216885
*PAR1:	yeah . 217115_217405
*PAR1:	well couldn't make it without those . 217715_219085
*PAR0:	no [/] no . 219465_220085
*PAR1:	but even so I kind of budget like &-um what I'll be able to afford . 220385_223765
*PAR1:	even when I graduate how much those loans are gonna add up to be . 223765_226525
*PAR1:	hmm you know so that I know exactly what I'll be owing . 227085_230005
*PAR0:	do you spend a lot of time though &-uh mapping out your budget . 230345_233965
*PAR0:	and . 234105_234325
*PAR1:	no . 235105_235325

*PAR1:	yeah . 254755_255045

*PAR1:	for four months we're gonna buy a refrigerator . 259705_261405
