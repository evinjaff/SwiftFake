*PAR0:	yeah . 72305_72595
*PAR1:	it is a blessing . 72595_73235
*PAR1:	but I just [/] just knowing him . 73975_76715
*PAR1:	he wouldn't go for anything like that . 76775_78355
*PAR1:	no way . 78495_78915
*PAR1:	really . 79135_79555
*PAR0:	no . 79895_80115
*PAR0:	well it's nice that he has family around . 80185_81915
*PAR0:	yeah you know . 82065_82555
*PAR0:	so then maybe that's not the only option . 82655_84475
*PAR0:	right . 84765_85115
*PAR0:	you know for so many people it is the only option . 85255_87235
*PAR0:	and . 87295_87515
*PAR1:	well that's true . 87665_88355
*PAR0:	I know here in Raleigh recently in Wake County around Raleigh &-um there was one nursing home that was going to be closed because of neglect of [/] of patients . 88835_98915
*PAR0:	and [/] and there were some questionable deaths at the home . 98975_102195
*PAR0:	and it really makes you think you know . 103815_105155
*PAR0:	yeah . 105305_105595
*PAR1:	it does because if you just think if your own family don't want to be bothered with you . 105595_111355
*PAR1:	what about someone else . 112225_113315
*PAR1:	mhm . 113335_113755
*PAR1:	of course they're getting paid of course . 113835_115195
*PAR0:	and then they're not taking good care of you . 116205_117545
*PAR1:	they're not taking good care of you exactly . 117575_119985
*PAR0:	that's [/] that's kind of scary . 120485_122185
*PAR0:	and I &-uh I don't know . 122445_124945
*PAR0:	I would certainly interview these places you know and ask them lots and lots of questions . 125105_131585
*PAR0:	and &-um you know one thing they say about when you're choosing a daycare for your child . 131685_135625
*PAR0:	is that you should drop in unannounced . 135685_137185
*PAR1:	right . 137795_138145
*PAR0:	and I would want to do that too . 138405_139465
*PAR0:	you know make sure they don't have everything spic and span just because it's visiting time or whatever . 139525_143185
*PAR0:	right . 143195_143545
*PAR1:	exactly . 143655_144145
*PAR0:	I think that would be one of the best things you could do . 144665_146225
*PAR0:	and [/] and I don't know one thing with me is I just try to rely on my gut reaction . 146405_150985
*PAR0:	mhm . 151245_151665
*PAR0:	you know if something's bothering me . 152005_153505
*PAR0:	if I don't feel good about something then probably there's a good reason why . 153505_156185
*PAR1:	yeah . 156695_156985
*PAR1:	that's a good idea though to do that . 157885_159825
*PAR1:	yeah . 160215_160505
*PAR1:	I [/] I think I would do the same thing . 161105_162665
*PAR1:	I'm sure there's a lot of cases where they've been mistreated . 163805_167185
*PAR1:	mhm . 167565_167985
*PAR1:	for whatever reason . 168145_169225
