*PAR1:	oh . 109225_109445
*PAR0:	so yes I got stones to [/] to build another stone retaining wall this morning up at the . 109465_116005
*PAR0:	oh how pretty up at the . 116025_117765
*PAR0:	well it's not really pretty . 117765_118925
*PAR0:	it's gonna be a retaining wall . 119035_120405
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's I wanna expand the garden . 120715_122645
*PAR0:	and it kind of goes down a slope . 122705_124125
*PAR0:	and I thought . 124185_124685
*PAR0:	mhm well why don't I just &-uh build a little stone wall . 124825_128365
*PAR0:	and they [/] they they're doing starting construction across the street again . 128425_131805
*PAR0:	so they came through with a big earth mover which unearthed huge amounts of stone . 131825_136405
*PAR0:	so it's just I can't . 136505_138205
*PAR0:	even I backed the car up as close as I can get . 138205_140765
*PAR0:	and then I went in and started lugging . 140785_142965
*PAR0:	out . 142965_143085
*PAR0:	I took my [/] my wheelbarrow . 143485_145325
*PAR0:	but it was broken unfortunately . 145325_146685
*PAR0:	and so I still got all I could want without having to even go anywhere in the wheelbarrow . 146865_151605
*PAR0:	because there's so many stones . 151765_152805
*PAR1:	oh neat . 152865_153325
*PAR1:	so . 153465_153685
*PAR0:	neat . 153685_153805
*PAR0:	it just dug up huge . 153825_155325
*PAR0:	it's just the most incredible rocky soil over there so . 155475_158365
*PAR1:	well so then <are you> [/] are you gonna like plant little stuff between the stones . 158515_162205
*PAR1:	so it looks pretty or is it . 162205_163325
*PAR0:	no . 163425_163645
*PAR0:	it's gonna be a retaining wall . 163645_164885
*PAR0:	it's gonna be like a it's a retaining wall . 164955_167925
*PAR1:	but usually on one side you can see the wall . 168105_170245
*PAR0:	yeah . 170755_171045
*PAR0:	<but that's gonna> [/] but that's gonna be underneath the trees back in the woods . 171045_176085
*PAR0:	sort of . 176115_176525
*PAR0:	oh . 176585_176805
*PAR1:	I see . 176885_177125
*PAR1:	so you . 177185_177565
*PAR0:	won't have to worry . 177565_178125
*PAR0:	so I'm [/] I'm raising the ground improving the ground . 178265_180845
*PAR0:	I've been working my soil so bad . 180955_182645
*PAR0:	I'm so tired . 182745_183325
*PAR0:	yesterday I completely redid a whole side of the flower garden . 183515_187605
*PAR0:	Watson no . 188585_189485
*PAR1:	are you doing pretty well with the animals . 189745_191725
*PAR1:	the little critters eating things . 191825_193205
*PAR0:	I'm doing much better . 193585_194605
*PAR0:	I mean I'm not I don't have animals . 194885_196125
*PAR0:	I have still have I have lots and lots of grasshoppers . 196285_199165
*PAR0:	I have a wicked time with grasshoppers . 199205_201085
*PAR0:	&-um but I think part of that's just because the weeds just got outta control close by . 201945_206245
*PAR0:	and so they had lots of places to hang out now . 206345_208925
*PAR1:	do you just mow the part you haven't gardened or what do you do with it . 208925_212045
*PAR1:	well . 212315_212605
*PAR0:	most of it's lawn . 212605_213365
*PAR0:	yeah . 213365_213605
*PAR0:	and I just got done mowing too . 213605_215325
*PAR0:	I haven't mowed for geez . 215445_217765
*PAR0:	almost two months . 218025_218965
*PAR0:	oh because we haven't had any rain . 219345_220965
*PAR0:	there's been no rain . 221075_222165
*PAR0:	so &-uh we finally started to get a little rain . 222305_225005
*PAR0:	and so I thought . 225065_225725
*PAR0:	well guess I'm on the lawn . 225755_227125
*PAR0:	yeah . 227315_227605
*PAR0:	but parts of it just didn't need it at all . 227785_229725
*PAR0:	so and then I did my got out my &-uh weed whacker . 229825_235445
*PAR1:	being recorded . 235695_236365
*PAR1:	I bet you've forgotten it by now . 236485_237805
*PAR1:	huh . 237825_238045
*PAR1:	what I bet you've forgotten by now that we're being recorded . 238195_240965
*PAR0:	well why do I . 241075_241725
*PAR1:	I was just listening to you talk . 241845_243005
*PAR1:	and I was thinking . 243005_243565
*PAR1:	why . 243825_244045
*PAR0:	do I . 244045_244445
*PAR1:	care . 244445_244565
*PAR1:	yeah you don't . 244795_245405
*PAR1:	I think it's gardening . 246045_247125
*PAR0:	is just the kind of thing to talk about . 247125_248325
*PAR0:	when you're being recorded . 248325_249165
*PAR0:	this is true . 249275_249765
*PAR0:	so I took out my weed whacker . 250425_251685
*PAR0:	and whacked around the electric fence . 251685_253765
*PAR0:	so it should be going better again . 253865_255565
*PAR0:	so do you . 255565_256245
*PAR1:	have your door in by now . 256245_257405
*PAR0:	oh god yes . 257865_258525
*PAR0:	I've got my door in my fenced yard . 258555_260125
*PAR0:	and Watson comes in and out and runs up and down the stairs and races outside again . 260225_264565
*PAR0:	oh cool . 264865_265285
*PAR0:	today he had a visiting dog that &-uh came over to what a nice pretty dog . 265815_270965
*PAR0:	&-uh one of those blue tick you know liver spotted type dogs . 271465_276765
*PAR0:	big dog kind of got left home and was wandering the streets . 277385_281165
*PAR0:	and so we took him in and called his owner . 281225_283005
*PAR0:	and Watson played with him for a long time . 283105_285125
*PAR0:	and had a really good time . 285145_286005
*PAR0:	so and I almost felt I felt bad when I sent him back home because they said . 286145_291005
*PAR0:	well he gets he's tied up all the time . 291005_292725
*PAR0:	and I thought . 292905_293445
*PAR0:	oh that poor dog . 293505_294485
*PAR0:	I wish I hadn't called you . 294605_296045

*PAR0:	you could just step outside but it's I went and got a &-um I picked I went to a stone quarry and picked out a stone . 318545_326365
*PAR0:	mhm . 326505_326925
*PAR0:	and had this great big stone delivered . 327065_328885
*PAR0:	and then they also delivered two stones that they put down in the river so I can go down and stand . 328885_333125
*PAR0:	it's really nice having a little couple because it used to be I'd go down . 334075_336925
*PAR0:	and I'd be in Muck and instead now and I'd go . 336925_339445
*PAR0:	and I stand on my beautiful stones . 339465_341125
*PAR1:	how neat . 342185_342645
*PAR1:	it sounds really nice . 343865_344925

*PAR0:	it's nice . 345685_346045
*PAR0:	yeah . 346195_346485
*PAR0:	so what have you been doing . 346825_347605
*PAR1:	well I've just been working . 348435_349645
*PAR1:	but I'm planning my next vacation . 349865_351885
*PAR1:	which is I'm going in September to Japan oh . 351975_355165
*PAR0:	a rich girl . 356045_356645
*PAR1:	well no . 357355_357885
*PAR1:	actually I'm going into debt to do it . 358285_359965
*PAR1:	but I decided you know I've been telling my students because Rako lived here two years ago . 359985_365805
*PAR1:	and she is the one that really said . 365865_367365
*PAR1:	come and stay with me . 367395_368565
*PAR1:	and then this other girl that I had as a student ten years ago still keeps in touch . 368945_373645
*PAR1:	and she called me and said . 373745_375325
*PAR1:	when are you coming . 375405_375965
*PAR1:	and I thought . 376025_376485
*PAR1:	if I don't go they're gonna stop asking me . 376485_378525
*PAR1:	and that way you know and this way at least it you know I can go and have a place to stay part of the time . 379025_384605
*PAR1:	anyway but I'm going on a courier flight too . 384665_387565
*PAR1:	you know where &-um you carry somebody else's luggage or something else . 387745_391765
*PAR1:	somebody drugs . 392485_393205
*PAR1:	well maybe don't . 393555_394565
*PAR0:	carry anything illegal . 394565_395645
*PAR0:	and if you're going to don't discuss it now on the taped conversation . 395705_398685
*PAR1:	well it's really like being a spy . 399395_401525
*PAR1:	you should see these instructions . 401585_403005
*PAR1:	I have you know it's just like you have to get to the airport and look for a guy in a blue jacket with a certain kind of insignia on it . 403085_409285
*PAR1:	and he will give you papers and take you to the luggage place . 409585_413805
*PAR1:	and check you in . 413865_414725
*PAR1:	and then the luggage will go . 414725_415885
*PAR1:	and then you have one carry on piece that you get to take . 415885_419045
*PAR1:	<and then> [/] and then when you get to Japan you have to deliver the papers to a guy that's at a certain location in the immigration area . 419105_427685
*PAR1:	and then he will take the luggage . 427865_429885
*PAR0:	I'm kind of things are you carrying . 429885_430685
*PAR1:	I think you're carrying probably I'm carrying boxes of stuff . 431845_435525
*PAR1:	or I might be carrying suitcases . 435705_437365
*PAR1:	I don't know . 437365_437805
*PAR0:	well I mean well what kind of things are in them . 437805_439285
*PAR1:	well I don't know . 440035_440965
*PAR1:	maybe documents or industrial stuff . 440965_443285
*PAR1:	I have no idea . 443525_444245
*PAR1:	but it's all it's I mean it's all legal . 444785_446365
*PAR1:	they guarantee it's legal . 446365_447445
*PAR1:	and there's a guy there that gives you the papers and takes the papers . 447505_450485
*PAR1:	so it's not like you go through . 450585_452805
*PAR1:	and the customs people say . 452805_454165
*PAR1:	well and the papers say . 454755_456445
*PAR1:	what's in the stuff . 456445_457285
*PAR1:	you know . 457345_457645
*PAR1:	but there's a guy there that to explain it . 457905_459965
*PAR1:	so supposedly it's gotta be legal stuff . 460065_463325
*PAR1:	and then when you come back <you call> [/] you call a man named Mr Norco and you tell them that you're back in town . 463585_469325
*PAR1:	and he'll tell you where to meet him . 469325_470605
*PAR1:	and then you go to the airport . 470605_472245
*PAR1:	and you meet a guy who may or may not give you things to bring back . 472625_477045
*PAR1:	because that's &-um that's not sure . 477445_479605
*PAR1:	but he gives you back your ticket . 479605_480845
*PAR1:	see when you get to Japan they take your return ticket . 480985_483845
*PAR1:	and you can't have it back until you come back . 484385_486685
*PAR1:	and so &-um then you get back then there's a guy at this end that meets you . 487465_491685
*PAR1:	and then it's he this is very bizarre . 492025_493965
*PAR1:	takes I know . 494015_494885
*PAR1:	but Buffy it's like a third of the cost of the round trip ticket to Japan in fact it's four hundred dollars round trip right to Japan so and it's like four hundred dollars . 495625_507205
*PAR1:	yeah Jesus . 507355_508085
*PAR0:	it must be about seventeen hundred from here . 508145_510005
*PAR1:	it's [/] it's twelve hundred from here . 510355_511805
*PAR1:	but it's I'm paying four . 512265_513565
*PAR1:	oh I was gonna say . 513705_514685
*PAR1:	I'm paying four hundred . 514705_515525
*PAR0:	yeah . 515955_516245
*PAR0:	oh that's very cheap . 516385_517285
*PAR1:	yeah . 517475_517765
*PAR1:	but &-um the and then if you have . 518185_520205
*PAR0:	a place to stay . 520205_520765
*PAR0:	right . 521095_521445
*PAR0:	of course . 521745_522045
*PAR0:	I understand it costs about eight hundred dollars a day to just walk around . 522125_525205
*PAR1:	well and I'm gonna get a train pass like you know they have in Europe but they have one in Japan because flying is real expensive . 525675_532845
*PAR1:	and I wanna go all these places . 532845_534085
*PAR1:	and everybody says . 534265_535445
*PAR1:	well you should fly there because you don't have very much time but one flight . 535445_539005
*PAR1:	so you . 539005_539285
*PAR0:	can get on one of those trains where they shove you in . 539285_541125
*PAR1:	right . 541125_541405
*PAR1:	a bullet . 541445_541725
*PAR0:	they push you in behind [/] behind . 541835_543805
*PAR0:	and pack you in . 543825_544805
*PAR1:	one [/] one flight in Japan like I wanted to go Hokkaido that's where Sapporo is you know in the very North [/] North part . 545505_552205
*PAR1:	and a round trip flight from Tokyo has cost more than my round trip flight to Japan so I mean really the bullet train is gonna be the only way to go . 552985_561725
*PAR1:	you know . 562305_562645
*PAR1:	and I figure like when I go there if I stay in those Japanese hotels where they have to Tommy me mats and rice walls and stuff . 563025_570085
*PAR1:	it's not so expensive . 570755_571965
*PAR1:	I just got a book yesterday to find where the cheap places are . 572405_575805
*PAR1:	so anyway I'm just going but so far I haven't been able to reach my friend in Tokyo that's Reco who lived here . 577385_584965
*PAR1:	did you meet Reco yeah . 585065_586125
*PAR0:	so how come you haven't been able to get a hold of her . 586265_588685
*PAR1:	because I don't have her phone number . 588685_590845
*PAR1:	and I wrote her a card . 591065_592125
*PAR1:	and she hasn't called me back or written me back . 592125_594325
*PAR1:	but the other girl already called me back . 595105_597565
*PAR1:	and [/] and we are set you know but Recos kind of the key . 597745_601765
*PAR1:	because she's in Tokyo and that's where I really need to have a place to put my stuff . 601965_605805
*PAR1:	you know . 605905_606205
*PAR0:	so how long are you gonna go for . 607585_608845
*PAR1:	eleven days I was gonna go for seven . 609505_612485
*PAR1:	but then I thought you know I'm going all that way . 612865_614845
*PAR1:	and I may never go there again . 615345_616925
*PAR1:	so I better take a little longer . 617185_619205
*PAR1:	but I couldn't afford to go more than eleven . 619265_621125
*PAR1:	because I figure even sometime I'll have to you know pay for rooms . 621485_625725
*PAR1:	and I have to pay for food . 626145_627765
*PAR1:	and they say that's real expensive . 627785_629405
*PAR1:	you know . 630145_630485
*PAR1:	yeah . 630515_630805
*PAR1:	a cup of coffee . 631045_631685
*PAR1:	five dollars . 631835_632405
*PAR0:	hamburger . 633475_634085
*PAR0:	twenty five dollars . 634545_635405
*PAR1:	twenty five dollars . 635405_636405
*PAR1:	so I'm gonna try and you know eat a lot of noodles and plain rice . 637105_641565
*PAR1:	I don't like to Japanese food very well . 641845_643125
*PAR0:	I don't either . 643405_643765
*PAR0:	I . 644045_644165
*PAR1:	wonder if they recorded that . 644165_645045
*PAR1:	I don't like having a secret though . 645525_647365
*PAR1:	so I figure if I'll stick to rice and noodles . 647745_650485
*PAR1:	and that can't be as expensive as Sushi and stuff which I don't like you know . 650905_655365
*PAR0:	so I like Tempura that's about . 656465_658325
*PAR1:	it I like Tempura and Teriyaki you right . 658325_661405
*PAR1:	&-um but beef . 662065_663405
*PAR1:	they . 663405_663645
*PAR0:	I like it cooked . 664285_664965
*PAR1:	very much so very [/] very cooked . 665275_667165
*PAR1:	but beef . 667545_668045
*PAR1:	they say it's just outrageous . 668045_669285
*PAR1:	so I figure I won't eat any beef while I'm there . 669425_671525
*PAR1:	oh that's all right . 671985_672645
*PAR1:	you know . 672745_673085
*PAR1:	and fish is okay . 673305_674325
*PAR1:	if it's fried so like Pura fish would be okay . 674325_677245
*PAR0:	you're gonna eat lots of rice and vegetables . 678105_679845
*PAR0:	lot of rice and . 679865_680565
*PAR1:	that's okay . 681985_682645
*PAR1:	I it's better that than spending lots of money and getting sick . 683565_686565
*PAR1:	anyway right . 686585_687405
*PAR1:	so [/] so I hear Charmaine's coming to visit too . 687465_690445

*PAR0:	and then I think I'm too tired . 787225_789125
*PAR0:	I just don't wanna do it . 789405_790405
*PAR0:	by the time I go back and forth to work . 790405_792205
*PAR0:	I just do so much stuff around the garden around the yard . 792845_796005
*PAR0:	I just am like looking around saying . 796205_799165
*PAR0:	actually I was thinking of you today as I was going through with my weed work where I thought Chris is this little tiny garden . 799445_803645
*PAR0:	and she has somebody that takes care of it . 803705_805605
*PAR1:	for her . 805625_805925
*PAR1:	yeah . 806275_806565
*PAR1:	and . 806785_807005
*PAR0:	I had this huge garden . 807045_808205
*PAR0:	and I've spent all of my time out here . 808305_811205
*PAR0:	and it just the garden is just getting <bigger and bigger> [/] and bigger . 811345_813925
*PAR0:	Ev all the time . 814025_814805
*PAR0:	and it eventually and I was watching Martha Stewart today . 814825_818165
*PAR0:	and she was walking down talking about her perennial gardens . 818625_820925
*PAR0:	three hundred foot perennial gardens that are twelve feet billion . 821095_823885

*PAR0:	are twelve feet wide . 825445_826445
*PAR0:	and I thought . 826585_827165
*PAR0:	Jesus I'm working out a perennial garden . 827375_829245
*PAR0:	but I can't imagine having something like that . 829345_831805
*PAR1:	well I think you probably have a pretty fine garden . 832435_834965
*PAR1:	and maybe we should call house . 835665_836965
*PAR1:	beautiful . 836965_837405
*PAR1:	maybe next two . 837455_838205
*PAR0:	right . 838335_838685
*PAR0:	no . 838825_839045
*PAR0:	I'd say <a couple more years> [/] a couple more years because I have really bad soil . 839065_842645
*PAR0:	and so I basically have to just replace soil . 842785_845285
*PAR0:	and <it takes> [/] it takes a long time . 845425_847725
*PAR0:	and it's a lot of money . 847945_848925
*PAR0:	and finally I'm getting some compost going . 848985_850925
*PAR0:	but it even takes a long time to get that going . 850925_852885
*PAR0:	and . 852985_853205
*PAR1:	well I cut dried roses off my rose bushes yesterday . 853595_856605

*PAR0:	and I sorted all the little rocks to the center of the big rocks to lining around the side . 935385_939845
*PAR0:	and pulled all the weeds . 939945_940925
*PAR0:	and it looked so pretty . 940925_941925

*PAR0:	and I planted the garden . 943545_944605
*PAR0:	and I mowed that huge big lawn and did the weed whacker . 944605_947605
*PAR0:	and I look around . 947605_949805

*PAR0:	and I and I've got I've finally gotten used to the fence . 974025_976325
*PAR0:	at first the fence just was so overwhelming . 976385_978285
*PAR0:	because it's a big fence . 978485_979245
*PAR0:	how high is it . 979945_980525
*PAR0:	it's &-uh six feet . 980675_981925

*PAR0:	uhhuh . 992325_992565
*PAR0:	and <it just> [/] it just overpowers the house . 992565_994685
*PAR0:	but I'm getting used to it . 994745_996565
*PAR0:	now [/] now to me it just looks like a [/] a <little farm> [/] little farm yard . 996585_1000325
*PAR0:	mhm . 1000465_1000885
*PAR0:	which I like . 1000965_1001645
*PAR0:	and next year it's gonna get roses and clus climbing up . 1002145_1005725
*PAR0:	so it'll get eventually it'll get all covered with flowers and stuff . 1006025_1009045
*PAR0:	oh pretty . 1009385_1009845
*PAR0:	but right now it's still a big over firing fence . 1010865_1013125
*PAR0:	but Watson loves it . 1013145_1014245
*PAR0:	oh yeah that's nice . 1015265_1016485
*PAR0:	and Watson stays in his area . 1016585_1018205
*PAR0:	now he stays in his yard . 1018265_1019445
*PAR0:	he did one day last one day about two weeks ago I came home from work . 1019465_1023965
*PAR0:	and there's this stuff chewed up all over the lawn . 1024345_1026605
*PAR0:	and I just thought . 1026665_1027445
*PAR0:	what the hell . 1027675_1028445
*PAR0:	and it was like the kind of places that Watson would chew it up . 1028905_1031325
*PAR0:	but he was sitting in the window you know looking at me from the house . 1031325_1034125
*PAR0:	and I thought . 1034225_1034605
*PAR0:	well you know and so I . 1034605_1036085
*PAR0:	he came outside . 1036185_1036925
*PAR0:	and he was you know I was picking up the stuff . 1037065_1039765
*PAR0:	and he's kind of slinking away . 1039765_1041165
*PAR0:	and I said . 1041165_1041565
*PAR0:	I know you couldn't have done it . 1041605_1042605
*PAR0:	Watson because you're in the house . 1042605_1043565
*PAR0:	so you don't have to slink away . 1043565_1044605
*PAR0:	mhm . 1044705_1045125
*PAR0:	and we had this guilt complex going . 1045225_1047605
*PAR0:	mhm because there's stuff chewed up in the yard . 1047605_1049605
*PAR0:	and so I went inside . 1049705_1050645
*PAR0:	and there was on my answering machine . 1050645_1052205
*PAR0:	<there was a> [/] there was a message from &-uh Rachel that said Watson was outside today . 1052655_1058845
*PAR0:	and [/] and &-uh we came by . 1058865_1060445
*PAR0:	and we &-uh we didn't think he should be running around because he was barking at some of the kids . 1060445_1064405
*PAR0:	and so we put him in the yard and put him inside the fence . 1064425_1067845
*PAR0:	and I couldn't figure out how he'd gotten out . 1067985_1070845
*PAR0:	and I finally realized that I think I probably just left it open by mistake on the back . 1070845_1075045
*PAR0:	oh but he just stayed in the yard all day . 1075385_1077525
*PAR0:	he didn't go anywhere . 1077525_1078285
*PAR0:	he did bark at some kids . 1078385_1079565
*PAR0:	which is why they locked him up right [/] right . 1079575_1081605
*PAR0:	but &-um now . 1081865_1082885
*PAR1:	how does he go in and out . 1082885_1083885

*PAR1:	that's good . 1093525_1094005
*PAR1:	and then he has his own little yard along the side . 1094745_1096925
*PAR0:	he has his the only yard . 1097225_1098365
*PAR0:	it goes along the back and along the side . 1098425_1100445

*PAR0:	and then he can run in the house . 1114505_1115605
*PAR0:	if somebody if he sees somebody he can see them from any way . 1115625_1119405
*PAR0:	they approach the house . 1119405_1120165
*PAR0:	right if they get in the house he can run right inside and bite them . 1120165_1122925
*PAR1:	right . 1123055_1123405

*PAR0:	I mean Zoe can't go back there because she gets trapped . 1134165_1136685
*PAR0:	so because it is tall . 1137705_1138765
*PAR0:	well she could really . 1139315_1140325
*PAR0:	but she she'd have to climb the wire . 1140385_1142445
*PAR0:	and right . 1142585_1143525
*PAR0:	so she's decided that it's actually not a place that she prefers which is fine with me . 1143785_1148405

*PAR1:	well no it's [/] it's more specific than that . 1190155_1192565

*PAR1:	do you have anything in September and they said . 1194285_1196045
*PAR1:	yes . 1196045_1196245

*PAR1:	the seven day starts on the tenth comes back on the seventeenth . 1206925_1209725
*PAR1:	and that's the one I was gonna do . 1210065_1211565
*PAR1:	but then I decided that was too short . 1211825_1213205
*PAR1:	so I called them back . 1213205_1214245
*PAR1:	and I said . 1214245_1214685
*PAR1:	do you have a [/] a [/] a slight longer one . 1214705_1217485
*PAR1:	they said . 1217565_1217925
*PAR1:	yeah we have eleven days starts on the twelfth comes back on the twenty first . 1217925_1221845
*PAR1:	so that's the one I'm doing . 1222385_1223445
*PAR1:	but see you have to go on their schedule . 1223505_1226085
*PAR1:	but I'm going on Singapore Airlines which everybody says is a wonderful airline . 1226425_1230405
*PAR0:	well I think you should have to go first class to protect the valuable luggage . 1230835_1234085
*PAR0:	well . 1234875_1235165
*PAR1:	absolutely . 1235765_1236005
*PAR1:	I have a new little suitcase that has one of those that has wheels . 1236765_1240405
*PAR1:	and that <you can put> [/] you can put it in the overhead compartment . 1240405_1243685
*PAR1:	you know it's [/] it's a regulation smallest size of those little suitcases . 1243785_1248285
*PAR1:	mhm . 1248285_1248685
*PAR1:	and so you can take that in there . 1249025_1250885
*PAR1:	I can take one carry-on bag . 1251165_1252725
*PAR1:	but I figure I can also wear a coat with lots of pockets . 1253025_1255925
*PAR1:	and I can also have a big purse . 1256265_1258005
*PAR1:	a giant purse . 1259005_1259725
*PAR0:	I think it's nice to have one bag . 1259885_1261205
*PAR0:	I think it's nice to have . 1261525_1262565
*PAR0:	yeah . 1262955_1263245
*PAR0:	it's a small amount of stuff . 1263245_1264285
*PAR0:	even if it's hard getting down to it it's really nice . 1264515_1267125
*PAR0:	once you've got it . 1267125_1267925
*PAR1:	right . 1268255_1268605
*PAR1:	I agree with you . 1268725_1269325
*PAR1:	the only thing I'm worried about is if I go to Hokkaido it's gonna be cold already . 1269705_1273685
*PAR1:	because that's like Alaska in September it's . 1273925_1276765
*PAR0:	not Alaska [/] Alaska . 1276905_1277645
*PAR1:	well it's that far north . 1278195_1279245
*PAR1:	no I think so . 1279465_1280885
*PAR1:	no [/] no . 1282025_1282965
*PAR0:	going to sink . 1283975_1284645
*PAR1:	oh I thought it was that high up . 1285025_1286725
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 1287125_1287725
*PAR0:	but then . 1287865_1288245
*PAR1:	the southern part is quite warm . 1288245_1289965
*PAR1:	you know it's . 1290305_1291005
*PAR0:	Alaska would be going across northern Russia . 1291185_1294125
*PAR1:	well the bottom of Alaska the part like that's around Juneau . 1296235_1300445
*PAR0:	way down . 1301705_1302365
*PAR0:	I think it'd be more like . 1302925_1304005
*PAR1:	Canada . 1304785_1305205
*PAR0:	yeah . 1305515_1305805
*PAR0:	more like . 1306235_1306725
*PAR1:	Toronto well that'd be better . 1308395_1309485
*PAR1:	but I still think it's cooler there than it is here you know . 1309545_1312485
*PAR0:	you should watch the Weather channel right now . 1312865_1315205
*PAR0:	because the Weather Channel is telling us what temperatures . 1315445_1318045
*PAR0:	I just happened to watch it . 1318485_1319405
*PAR0:	I don't usually watch it . 1319485_1320445
*PAR0:	but if for some reason I was watching it the other day . 1320445_1322565
*PAR0:	and it was telling me what the temperature was in Greece and [/] and about the storm going across Czechoslovakia oh wow . 1322625_1329205
*PAR0:	it just sort of basically told you [/] you know what the weather was like . 1329265_1332205
*PAR0:	and . 1332265_1332485
*PAR0:	mhm . 1332485_1332805
*PAR0:	and it was funny to watch . 1332905_1334285
*PAR0:	you know how <when we> [/] when we look at storms here and [/] and well I don't know about you . 1334665_1338085
*PAR0:	but when we look at storms here we always watch the Midwest and see it coming across the Midwest come over here . 1338185_1343325
*PAR0:	right we watch . 1343325_1343605
*PAR1:	see a Pacific . 1343605_1344165
*PAR0:	ocean . 1344165_1344445
*PAR0:	right . 1344575_1344925
*PAR0:	we watch the Midwest and see it coming across or sometimes up from Florida and it just seemed funny that Europe watched you know all the . 1344925_1352125
*PAR0:	it's like it's coming over from England across France it just seems weird to see it going across eight countries the same way . 1352195_1358605
*PAR0:	here . 1358605_1358805
*PAR0:	it just would go across a few states . 1358805_1360405
*PAR1:	right [/] right . 1360535_1361365
*PAR0:	but anyway so they showed storms going through and stuff . 1361985_1363965
*PAR0:	and [/] and I'm sure that they have Japan as well . 1363965_1365925
*PAR0:	you need to get used to your weather channel so you can tune in and see what the weather is like . 1365925_1370165
*PAR1:	I don't know how to . 1370605_1371485
*PAR0:	find the Weather channel . 1371485_1372245
*PAR0:	but maybe I should do you have cable . 1372305_1373685
*PAR0:	yeah I do . 1373955_1374405
*PAR0:	then you probably have it . 1374555_1375525
*PAR1:	I think I do . 1375885_1376405
*PAR1:	I just don't know where because they haven't sent me for a long time . 1376525_1380205
*PAR1:	the numbers but the numbers are so . 1381025_1382765
*PAR0:	it's in the tv guy . 1383195_1384365

*PAR1:	well see . 1389315_1389805
*PAR1:	but all every city has a different cable company here . 1389805_1392725
*PAR0:	right . 1392725_1393045
*PAR0:	but in [/] in the Sunday newspaper at the very front there's a listing of all the towns . 1393045_1397805
*PAR0:	and what doesn't yours have that . 1397865_1399805
*PAR1:	it only prints about tv week . 1400185_1401565
*PAR1:	they only print about five of them . 1401635_1403085
*PAR1:	oh . 1403385_1403605
*PAR1:	but there are over twenty or so . 1403705_1405565
*PAR0:	oh see mine has way more . 1405785_1406965
*PAR0:	mine has about thirty listed across the top all the different towns . 1407035_1410405
*PAR0:	and then it's got all the different the cars would do that . 1410425_1412805
*PAR0:	it's a two page thing . 1412995_1414525
*PAR0:	and all across the top are all the different towns and the different cables . 1414825_1417845
*PAR0:	and then all down the left hand side is all the different channels . 1417845_1421085
*PAR0:	and then you go over and match up your town with what channels you get . 1421265_1424805
*PAR0:	so it's this big two [/] two page spread of [/] of &-uh because I yeah I'm the same way . 1425545_1430925
*PAR0:	they give you a little thing when you get it . 1430925_1432325
*PAR0:	and then that's it . 1432325_1433045
*PAR1:	right . 1433255_1433605
*PAR1:	and <I don't> [/] I don't have they don't do that in the at least . 1433665_1436445

*PAR1:	so like when I needed to borrow money so dad could move from the house to the condo . 1509145_1512965
*PAR1:	I don't know if you knew I did that . 1513125_1514045
*PAR1:	but I had to borrow some money . 1514145_1515165
*PAR1:	and he is the guy that approved it . 1515545_1517285
*PAR1:	and he knows Ray and he really liked that . 1517985_1520285
*PAR1:	and he said . 1520285_1520725
*PAR1:	he'd visited him a few times you know and stuff . 1520725_1523085
*PAR1:	and it was kind of neat you know because he talked about the times like the old guys talked about the . 1523385_1527925
*PAR1:	times . 1527925_1528125
*PAR1:	right . 1528175_1528525
*PAR1:	you know not like the new guys talk about the times . 1528525_1530965
*PAR1:	in fact he talked about the new guys and how the times was not so cool anymore . 1531385_1534805
*PAR1:	but it was kind of neat you know to meet him . 1534805_1537245
*PAR1:	yeah . 1537515_1537805
*PAR1:	his name was Jean Ell he [/] he knew about you . 1537985_1541005
*PAR1:	and he knew about Tom he knew about you know he wa . 1541105_1544005
*PAR0:	evil bitch . 1544115_1544805
*PAR1:	he yes he knew about the evil bitch . 1545705_1547365
*PAR1:	and he [/] he I think he knew that they had gotten divorced . 1547425_1550245
*PAR1:	or he knew that they were having problems . 1550785_1552405
*PAR1:	because he'd been there when she was railing against dad for some reason or other . 1552685_1556845
*PAR1:	and she couldn't hide it you know . 1556865_1558445
*PAR1:	so [/] so yeah he did . 1558785_1560645
*PAR1:	hmm . 1561325_1561405
*PAR1:	so anyway that was kind of interesting . 1561785_1563445
*PAR1:	he knew that dad had passed away and stuff like that you know so . 1563825_1567965
*PAR0:	but he didn't know enough to tell us about the insurance . 1569145_1571165
*PAR0:	it changed the name on picture . 1573065_1574405
*PAR1:	no . 1574785_1575005
*PAR1:	you know I'm gonna mention that to him . 1575005_1576565
*PAR1:	I'll probably see him this week . 1576635_1577725
*PAR1:	because we have another meeting in this group . 1577925_1579205
*PAR1:	and I just might mention that to him . 1579265_1580965
*PAR1:	you know that was a big mistake . 1581065_1583725
*PAR0:	really . 1583985_1584405
*PAR1:	actually if I had known that you know we might've been able to get some proof that dad really had changed it in some way or something . 1585925_1592325
*PAR1:	I dunno . 1592445_1592845
*PAR0:	no probably not . 1593145_1594045

*PAR0:	yeah it's gone . 1594915_1595965
*PAR0:	thank god . 1595965_1596485
*PAR0:	thank God we don't have to deal with any of that . 1596655_1598765
*PAR0:	this is true . 1598915_1599445
*PAR1:	this . 1599835_1600125
*PAR0:	is true . 1600125_1600445
*PAR0:	so I assume Tom at some point collected his money . 1600745_1603645
*PAR1:	yeah . 1604315_1604605
*PAR1:	he never said anything to anybody . 1604665_1606165
*PAR1:	but like the check came back . 1606265_1607845
*PAR1:	so I know he did . 1607945_1609165
*PAR0:	how long did it take him to cash it [/] it . 1609345_1611205
*PAR1:	well it came back . 1611275_1612085
*PAR1:	it took it more than a month . 1612225_1613405
*PAR1:	it was I think the second month that it had been out you know but so I don't know . 1613425_1618125
*PAR0:	so he finally decided to [/] to claim his [/] his &-uh certified mail . 1618225_1623165
*PAR0:	I didn't know if he'd ever claim his certified mail . 1623445_1625445
*PAR0:	yeah . 1625445_1625685
*PAR0:	but I guess he did . 1625685_1626525
*PAR1:	I guess . 1626965_1627285
*PAR1:	yeah . 1627755_1628045
*PAR1:	so and I haven't talked to Steve I've been meaning to call him because I just wanted to you know check in with him . 1628505_1635845
*PAR1:	and also I promised him I'd buy him a drink . 1635845_1637965
*PAR1:	but actually I think he should buy me a drink . 1638585_1640405
*PAR1:	but I haven't done that . 1640425_1641365
*PAR1:	so oh I had a question about taxes or something you know . 1641505_1645165
*PAR1:	so but I [/] I [/] I guess I'll do it sometime because I like Steve you know . 1645265_1650325
*PAR0:	yeah . 1650915_1651205
*PAR0:	I like Steve too . 1651205_1652005
*PAR1:	he's a nice man . 1652395_1653205
*PAR0:	he's a nice man serious procrastinator . 1653435_1655405
*PAR0:	but a nice man . 1655425_1656205
*PAR0:	right . 1656205_1656525
*PAR1:	serious procrastinator . 1657235_1659045
*PAR1:	one of the best . 1659225_1659965
*PAR1:	yeah . 1661835_1662125
*PAR1:	so how's your job . 1662145_1663045
*PAR0:	oh boring . 1663825_1665125
*PAR0:	but I'm getting used to the fact that I lived a boring life . 1665185_1667885
*PAR0:	I keep saying . 1668565_1669165
*PAR0:	you lived an exciting life . 1669225_1670685
*PAR0:	when you were in your twenties . 1670685_1671845
*PAR0:	you moved around . 1672385_1673125
*PAR0:	had lots of jobs . 1673145_1673845
*PAR0:	went lots of places . 1673915_1674765
*PAR0:	now you're just gonna sit here and tell you . 1675665_1678245
*PAR0:	Rod . 1678345_1678565
*PAR1:	well I tell myself that too . 1679315_1680725
*PAR1:	because I'm not happy in my job right now . 1680965_1682605
*PAR1:	and I keep thinking . 1682605_1683325
*PAR1:	well you could change it . 1683325_1684165
*PAR1:	but the other hand I really have a pretty good situation in terms of flexibility . 1684165_1689725
*PAR0:	so right . 1690345_1690925
*PAR0:	I do too . 1691165_1691565
*PAR0:	and but let me tell you how uneasy it is to change it once you reach forty five . 1691585_1697405
*PAR1:	well that's right . 1697875_1698605
*PAR1:	I mean I'd have to have a pretty good place to go to . 1698725_1700845
*PAR1:	but no jobs are secure anymore . 1701665_1703365
*PAR0:	I know that's another reason that I don't mind it quite so much . 1703725_1706245
*PAR0:	mhm . 1706245_1706525
*PAR0:	it's just freaky when you realize that you know when dad was you know young or he could you know support a family . 1706605_1714285
*PAR0:	it's like they said you could put support a family on any job . 1714595_1717245
*PAR0:	if you had a job it would be if you worked in a gas station whatever you did . 1717745_1722045
*PAR0:	if you had a job it was enough money to support yourself . 1722105_1724685
*PAR0:	mhm . 1724685_1725045
*PAR0:	mhm . 1725185_1725605
*PAR0:	but now of course it's you know having a job means nothing . 1725685_1729165
*PAR0:	and you could be gone at any minute . 1729225_1730805
*PAR0:	and there's this huge separation of [/] of &-uh incomes that didn't used to exist . 1730805_1736405
*PAR0:	exactly you know a doctor used to be just somebody who made good money but it wasn't . 1736475_1740845
*PAR1:	and management doesn't value [/] value loyalty or even competence that much . 1740845_1744685
*PAR1:	I mean you know maybe it's I don't know why it is that incompetence is allowed to go . 1744925_1749885
*PAR1:	it's . 1750715_1751005
*PAR0:	union . 1751005_1751085
*PAR0:	it's unionizing but . 1751675_1752885
*PAR1:	it's not just unions because . 1752885_1754125
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's like I think unions have just made mediocrity . 1754755_1757445
*PAR0:	it's like you know Julie's union . 1757675_1759405
*PAR0:	you know Julie has I've told you is having has become a terrible alcoholic . 1759785_1763645
*PAR0:	yeah . 1763755_1764045
*PAR0:	and her union is really I think partly the part the fact that she had the leniency with her union to let this happen . 1764185_1771245
*PAR0:	yeah is why it happened . 1771555_1772805
*PAR0:	you know I think if she had [/] had to have a job and had to be sober to go to work she would've been . 1772905_1776765
*PAR0:	yeah . 1776915_1777205
*PAR0:	but she was allowed through the leniency of this union to take all this time off . 1777305_1782685
*PAR0:	and all she did with her time off was just get drunk and shit . 1782685_1785245
*PAR0:	and . 1785245_1785445
*PAR1:	drunker <and drunk> [/] and drunk . 1785445_1786365
*PAR1:	I [/] I think that's true in some cases . 1786525_1788005
*PAR1:	but I don't think it's true in every case . 1788145_1789645
*PAR1:	but I do I [/] I do think that because we've become more litigious too that people you know they [/] they feel that incompetence is not a valid reason to be fired . 1789705_1798125
*PAR1:	so they sue . 1798265_1799005
*PAR1:	and . 1799505_1799725
