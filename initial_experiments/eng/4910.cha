*PAR0:	I don't know that [/] that seems like a lot . 4085_5485
*PAR0:	I mean I think you know it would be nice . 7425_8665
*PAR0:	especially like you know when people are kids are going in college they should do some public service . 8665_12225
*PAR1:	&-um <part of> [/] part of it though . 13445_16345
*PAR1:	I mean I agree with you . 17185_17905
*PAR1:	sometimes it sounds like a lot . 17905_19265
*PAR1:	but I think less than a year they don't learn enough . 19565_23285
*PAR1:	I think you just about have to be away from home for a full year under less than ideal conditions to learn some of the &-uh you know lessons that really need to be learned . 24845_35765
*PAR1:	<may I> [/] may I ask how old you . 36945_38445

*PAR1:	so you might have been affected right . 40845_42205
*PAR1:	so . 45145_45365
*PAR1:	yeah <I really> [/] I really feel that . 45795_47485

*PAR0:	that's true . 53105_53605
*PAR0:	yeah . 53605_53885

*PAR0:	some people spend far too much time . 54515_55765
*PAR1:	yeah . 57635_57925
*PAR0:	I mean you're doing the same thing . 57965_59045
*PAR0:	and that and not really you know seeing any other part of the world . 59045_61685
*PAR1:	yeah . 61835_62125

*PAR0:	oh I know without . 72105_73285
*PAR1:	the comforts that mom and dad provide if I mean if you're lucky enough to have both . 73285_76965
*PAR1:	but &-uh but &-um yeah I [/] I think it would be wonderful . 77145_80745
*PAR1:	and I think it would broaden the [/] the horizons of the kids for really the way the rest of the world the rest of the country lives . 82925_91085
*PAR0:	well it certainly would . 92395_93325
*PAR0:	but . 93945_94165
*PAR1:	<it's a> [/] it's a matter of getting a feeling for humanity itself . 96085_99375
*PAR1:	I think . 99495_99775
*PAR0:	yeah . 100565_100855
*PAR1:	have you been in the service at all . 101975_103345

*PAR1:	I don't know why I left . 111585_112585
*PAR1:	please forgive me . 112645_113585
*PAR1:	no . 113765_113985
*PAR0:	that's [/] that's okay . 113985_114465
*PAR1:	it has to have been awful . 114805_115865
*PAR0:	it [/] it was I mean you know I heard gunfire . 116205_119825
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's the first time I felt my wife was you know a little bit threatened . 119825_123265
*PAR0:	so it's &-uh . 124365_125265
*PAR1:	I'm so distressed with the media . 125925_127305
*PAR1:	the [/] the [/] the people in the helicopter that did not land and save that guy from being killed . 128485_132865
*PAR0:	I know . 133625_133905
*PAR0:	but they [/] <they never> [/] they never interfere . 135905_137605
*PAR0:	they just . 137635_138125
*PAR1:	well I mean this is not like we're fighting a war someplace else . 138475_141605
*PAR0:	I know . 142245_142525
*PAR1:	<this is> [/] this is the bad guys were killing us . 143715_146085
*PAR1:	I'm sorry . 146625_146965
*PAR1:	you know I just can't believe that they didn't go down there and stop that from happening . 147105_150685
*PAR0:	I mean it seems like you know basic [/] basic decency would you know require them to do it . 151615_155535
*PAR0:	but . 155635_155855
*PAR1:	I [/] I would think so . 156575_157495
*PAR1:	but &-uh are you married . 157595_159055
*PAR0:	no I'm not . 159235_159735
*PAR1:	so you don't have anybody yet that you have to feel that you have to . 159995_162575
*PAR0:	protect . 162575_162895
*PAR0:	right . 162985_163335
*PAR1:	but &-uh well let's think on this for a moment . 164035_167855
*PAR1:	if [/] if you had been required sometime around the age of twenty to spend a year someplace doing something . 168115_174825
*PAR1:	what [/] what sort of things might you feel would be &-uh the type of things that would do good for the country . 175655_181005
*PAR0:	I don't know . 182805_183205
*PAR0:	I [/] I think it a lot of it's just you know seeing how other people live . 183285_186645
*PAR0:	I mean you know I tend to be you know in my own circles of friends . 186845_190205
*PAR0:	and we're all pretty much the same upper . 190465_193755
*PAR1:	middle class . 193755_194275
*PAR1:	probably . 194675_194755
*PAR0:	probably or . 196395_196915
*PAR1:	are you higher than that . 196915_197755
*PAR0:	no . 198295_198515
*PAR0:	I live in California so what it's not really upper middle class . 198595_202475
*PAR0:	here is the problem . 202475_203275
*PAR1:	yeah that's true . 204505_205195
*PAR0:	&-um . 205935_206155
*PAR1:	do you feel that . 207535_208275
*PAR1:	&-um well I [/] I personally feel that six weeks of basic training ought to be a mandatory part of this year . 208375_213795
*PAR1:	do you have any feelings about that . 215335_216595
*PAR0:	mhm . 217015_217435
*PAR0:	&-um but what about the people who don't make it . 218455_220235
*PAR0:	I mean <what do> [/] what do you do with them . 220395_221955
*PAR1:	well you . 223385_224155
*PAR1:	okay . 224625_224915
*PAR1:	you make it as rigorous as you can . 224975_226555
*PAR1:	right for everybody you know . 226765_229115
*PAR1:	and if they just can't make it &-uh it's like other things . 229215_231915
*PAR1:	you [/] you lessen it so that they can make it . 231935_234155
*PAR1:	you try to demand that much of them . 235255_236795
*PAR1:	but if they can't make it . 236815_237795
*PAR1:	and [/] and there are people you know <who are not> [/] who are not as healthy and so on and so forth . 237795_242235
*PAR1:	but they can find other things for them to do also . 243465_245405
*PAR0:	oh sure . 245405_245725
*PAR0:	I'm sure there's [/] there's plenty to do . 245865_247165
*PAR1:	I mean it's [/] it's like in high school or [/] or junior high or wherever that certain people are excused from going to gym class or whatever . 248175_256355
*PAR1:	but in the mean almost everybody has to do it . 256975_259275
*PAR0:	yeah . 262715_263005
*PAR0:	I [/] I can relate to that . 263005_265045
*PAR0:	I [/] I do think you know people [/] people need to [/] to meet other types of people . 266615_269815
*PAR0:	well by just you know living [/] living in different ways than they do . 270695_273705
*PAR1:	and yeah . 275285_275825
*PAR1:	and College doesn't really do . 275845_277185
*PAR0:	it . 277185_277305
*PAR0:	no not [/] not at all . 277725_278665
*PAR0:	yeah . 278665_278945
*PAR1:	first of all not everybody gets a chance to go to college . 278945_281065
*PAR1:	but in college . 281685_282425
*PAR1:	I mean you're still among basically the same class of people that you've grown up with . 282705_287585
*PAR0:	right . 287675_288025
*PAR1:	so you don't get to see how the other half lives or the other two thirds or however many there are . 288815_293595
*PAR1:	now . 293595_293795
*PAR1:	&-um I [/] I am old enough . 295025_297445
*PAR1:	I'm over fifty . 297665_298405
