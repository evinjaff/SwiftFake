*PAR0:	you . 168455_168675
*PAR1:	get past the back to school crowd . 168675_170995
*PAR1:	yeah . 171985_172275
*PAR1:	and past the worst of the heat I hope . 172855_176195
*PAR0:	well that's not true . 177065_178115
*PAR1:	oh . 178815_179035
*PAR0:	&-uh September's pretty hot here . 180185_181805
*PAR0:	&-um but well how's the air conditioner in your car . 182985_189245

*PAR1:	we will be okay . 191825_192525
*PAR1:	coming . 192525_192845
*PAR1:	yeah it is . 193155_194805
*PAR1:	and I imagine on [/] on the boat while there'll be places we can hide out . 195385_200845
*PAR1:	that'll be cool . 200875_201765
*PAR0:	yeah . 202355_202645
*PAR0:	when Linda and I took the cruise in the Caribbean it was very hot outdoors hot and muggy . 202645_207725
*PAR0:	mhm . 207725_208085
*PAR0:	and the indoors was all air conditioned . 208225_210045
*PAR0:	and so you almost had to wear a sweater when you were at dinner . 210985_214845
*PAR0:	and then outdoors was swimsuit weather . 215265_218285
*PAR1:	mhm . 218505_218925
*PAR0:	and Los Angeles you know is pretty changeable . 220505_223325
*PAR0:	I've noticed . 224315_224765
*PAR0:	the major thing is that there's so much difference between day and night . 226425_229245
*PAR1:	yeah . 229995_230285
*PAR0:	so you have to be clear in layers . 231545_233205
*PAR1:	for the evening . 233745_234365
*PAR1:	why . 234625_234845
*PAR0:	yeah . 235315_235605
*PAR0:	perfect weather for sweaters and shawls at night . 237765_240375
*PAR1:	well I said . 241445_242215
*PAR1:	even if &-uh we thought we were going to be too warm coming across country . 242215_248735
*PAR1:	&-uh we still ought to stick our winter coats in the trunk . 249635_252535
*PAR0:	winter coats . 253395_254655
*PAR1:	just in case &-uh we had weather here which was a hundred degrees for ten days in a row . 255125_266635
*PAR0:	yes . 267255_267475
*PAR1:	and then it dropped down to fifty two . 268175_270195
*PAR0:	which in the springtime would feel like balmy . 271645_274755
*PAR0:	and after a hundred degrees feels like get out the furs . 275095_277875
*PAR1:	right . 278395_278675
*PAR0:	I know that's . 280515_281035
*PAR1:	why we everybody had jackets . 281035_282915
*PAR0:	that's why we complain and carry on . 283255_285075
*PAR0:	so in the wintertime it's because we all are so used to having the weather be warmer than that [/] that . 285215_290795
*PAR0:	but heavens . 291335_291955
*PAR0:	if it gets down to fifty we're all &-uh in sixty seven layers of clothes . 291955_297195
*PAR0:	I had such a nice thing happen with speaking of clothes . 301515_304555
*PAR0:	&-uh the foster mom who had Pearl and Angie before me lives in Atlanta . 305295_312355
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 312885_313235
*PAR0:	and so while we were there we got to see her . 313535_315555
*PAR0:	and she gave me two great big bags of hand-me-downs for the kids . 316135_320115
*PAR1:	to take back on the airplane . 321935_323475
*PAR1:	well . 323785_324075
*PAR0:	you know I had known that she was going to do that . 324075_325875
*PAR0:	and so I had brought along &-um nylon duffle bag . 325895_330915
*PAR0:	oh . 331295_331515
*PAR0:	so I had room to put the extra stuff into . 331855_334475
*PAR1:	good idea . 334985_335635
*PAR0:	aren't . 336775_337195
*PAR1:	you smart . 337195_337635
*PAR0:	some of the things were well right after she gave them to us the next day I had all the kids wearing things that came from her . 337985_345155
*PAR1:	oh . 345855_346075
*PAR0:	they were that perfect . 347105_348555
*PAR0:	and Joseph picked out some of the things from there . 349615_351795
*PAR0:	and I told him that they came from his friend Peter and he was just beside himself . 351815_357405
*PAR0:	this was very exciting to wear clothes that came from Peter . 357435_360445
*PAR1:	by the way I looked up in my birthday book . 362825_365125
*PAR0:	yes . 365505_365725
*PAR1:	I don't have anybody down for the last of July oh . 366725_370445
*PAR0:	okay . 370445_370685
*PAR1:	I just was on the wrong page I guess . 371525_373725
*PAR0:	me either . 374665_375045
*PAR0:	I don't have anybody for the end of your wife . 375165_376805
*PAR0:	however I do have two birthdays that are on the twenty fourth of the month . 377555_381045
*PAR0:	Angie and David are both twenty fourth of the month . 382615_385285
*PAR1:	I know about David that's . 385645_387045
*PAR0:	Christmas eve . 387325_387925
*PAR0:	yes . 388145_388365
*PAR0:	well Angie is about Thanksgiving . 388395_390245
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 391645_391995
*PAR0:	this year she was exactly Thanksgiving . 393265_395235
*PAR1:	well I don't know how I got mixed up . 396145_398035
*PAR1:	but I do flaky things sometimes . 398135_400115
*PAR0:	do you think happen . 400295_402835
*PAR0:	you know I occasionally have dreams that are so real that I wake up absolutely convinced that I know as fact whatever it is that I just dreamed about . 404415_414395
*PAR1:	you have to act on it . 414735_416075
*PAR0:	well you know and this is not something recent . 416985_418835
*PAR0:	this is not an aging thing . 419025_420595
*PAR0:	I was always crazy . 421355_422355
*PAR0:	I remember once years ago . 426555_427755
*PAR0:	&-um getting up one morning . 428375_431525
*PAR0:	let's see . 432215_432645
*PAR0:	we were still living in Columbus at the time . 432645_434645
*PAR0:	and coming in to tell you in the bathroom . 435305_437165
*PAR0:	and we had been in Lincoln shortly before that to tell you that &-um June Marie had gotten married or gotten engaged . 437545_445165
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 445895_446245
*PAR0:	now I don't remember whether it was married or engaged . 446465_447925
*PAR0:	but anyway the more I thought about it during the day . 448065_451285
*PAR0:	the more I thought . 451305_452085
*PAR0:	I don't know if that's true or not . 452605_454205
*PAR0:	and it turned . 455325_455805
*PAR0:	and &-uh finally I checked on it . 455985_457685
*PAR0:	and it turned out . 457685_458285
*PAR0:	no it wasn't I made it up it I was so came out of a dream . 458285_462765
*PAR0:	I just convinced it was real . 463045_465045
*PAR0:	and then I couldn't quite put all the pieces together to re-visualize why I knew that . 466825_474085
*PAR0:	which made me doubtful . 474855_476125
*PAR1:	isn't that strange . 476855_478085
*PAR0:	and it still happens to me occasionally . 480625_482325
*PAR1:	I got a letter from Jackie . 486165_487645
*PAR0:	yes . 488625_488845
*PAR1:	&-uh no word yet on . 489625_491925
*PAR1:	&-uh either selling their house or finding a job . 493025_496605
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 497295_497645

*PAR1:	I suppose . 533445_533805
*PAR0:	yeah . 534155_534445
*PAR1:	isn't that interesting . 535945_537095
*PAR0:	yes . 537515_537735
*PAR1:	and she says she started walking every morning before she goes to work and hasn't lost an ounce . 539805_546665
*PAR0:	and lost an ounce . 547765_548745
*PAR1:	hasn't . 549045_549465
*PAR0:	oh I was gonna say . 549805_550545
*PAR0:	how could you tell if you've lost an ounce it . 550565_553665
*PAR1:	hasn't made an ounce of difference . 553665_555465
*PAR0:	I see . 555825_556185
*PAR1:	and &-uh so she says as soon as she's all through a pizza hut she's gonna start Ized again . 557045_563025
*PAR0:	good . 563775_564065
*PAR1:	just attending glasses . 564295_565425
*PAR0:	mhm . 565685_566105
*PAR0:	you know today the doctor told Rochelle had to go to the doctor today . 567765_570785
*PAR0:	and the doctor told her that she was overweight . 570805_572985
*PAR1:	oh no . 573485_573905
*PAR0:	and we have had some problems with Rochelle in the past . 574925_577945
*PAR0:	and I always try to be really gentle in what I say to her about her weight . 578205_582145
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 582515_582865
*PAR0:	because she's had some inappropriate eating behaviors . 582975_587705
*PAR0:	&-um like the making herself throw up stuff . 588965_592185
*PAR1:	oh . 592685_592905
*PAR0:	no . 592965_593185
*PAR0:	and the &-um . 593485_594625
*PAR1:	blame me . 595315_595905
*PAR1:	Anor her brother . 596295_597425
*PAR0:	yeah . 597495_597785
*PAR0:	yeah . 598135_598425
*PAR0:	she's had some strange stuff . 598835_601065
*PAR0:	also she went through a period where she was saying that she was throwing up all the time . 601175_605105
*PAR0:	and she wasn't . 605105_605825
*PAR0:	hmm or at least if she was there was no evidence of it . 607105_610305
*PAR0:	a bid . 610745_611065
*PAR1:	for Hendrick . 611125_611905
*PAR0:	yeah . 612295_612585
*PAR0:	yeah that was it was very strange . 613135_615425
*PAR0:	that was back a number of years ago . 616495_618465
*PAR0:	anyway I try to be real gentle in what I say because Jody is real nasty . 618485_623145
*PAR0:	he just is rude . 624525_625465
*PAR0:	yeah . 626055_626345
*PAR0:	and he and all brothers I guess are rude . 626405_630465
*PAR0:	but he's more rude that I think than [/] than seems necessary to me . 630525_635225
*PAR0:	he rides her hard all the time about everything . 637645_640665
*PAR1:	I [/] I think this is normal . 641345_642785
*PAR0:	and I thought the doctor was maybe a little more abrupt than he needed to be . 643645_650575
*PAR0:	it wasn't our regular doctor . 650675_652095
*PAR0:	mhm . 652315_652735
*PAR0:	so I'm working with her attitude on it . 656395_659855
*PAR0:	and she's gone through some real depression about weight because she tends to have friends who are built like Jackie and Jenny . 659955_669455
*PAR1:	Uhuh . 670045_670335
*PAR0:	and yeah you know one of the things mall she won't go to the mall . 671235_675095
*PAR0:	the teenage girls like to do is go to them with her friends because they want to go into these teeny tiny shops . 675115_681655
*PAR0:	the three five and seven or price . 681915_683735
*PAR1:	on . 684195_684415
*PAR0:	yes . 684915_685135
*PAR0:	and then they want her to try things on and things don't fit . 685155_688375
*PAR0:	yeah . 688765_689055
*PAR0:	and she feels like they're deliberately humiliating her because she feels so humiliated . 689195_695375
*PAR0:	and surely they must have known this would be humiliating . 695475_698135
*PAR0:	well I'm sure they are completely clueless . 698205_701295
*PAR0:	so understand how terrible it feels to her . 701915_704255
*PAR0:	but I also her . 704475_705855
*PAR0:	yeah . 706205_706495
*PAR0:	and she wears about a size fourteen . 706555_708455
*PAR0:	and she's just having such a rough time with that . 710195_714475
*PAR0:	Jenny told her she needs new friends . 715165_716755
*PAR1:	that one . 718665_719155
*PAR0:	well normal size . 719745_721195
*PAR0:	she has friends that look like . 722855_724435

*PAR0:	and she just needs some more normal sized friends . 733855_737955
*PAR1:	I got to thinking my very best friends were always short . 739635_744395
*PAR1:	and I don't know if it's because I was short myself taller . 747575_751515

*PAR0:	and in high school her nickname was legs . 768815_770795

*PAR0:	mhm . 785845_786265
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 788125_788505

*PAR0:	when you're gonna be sitting in a conference room for a long time . 797455_799945
*PAR0:	so you have something to put on the floor to put your feet on . 800125_802305
*PAR1:	and how finally you get Arick in your neck . 805685_808025

*PAR0:	oh good . 833205_833705

*PAR1:	it get lots of different to . 865505_867885
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 868855_869205
*PAR0:	rhythm . 869985_870405
*PAR0:	I wonder how much variety they've gone for in the speakers of English . 870645_874205
*PAR1:	because they ask &-um the Civics where I grew up . 875475_879125
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 879295_879645
*PAR1:	also &-um the years of complete education . 882635_886405
*PAR0:	complete education . 889005_889725
*PAR1:	yeah . 889955_890245
*PAR0:	like if you only went for half of a year that doesn't count . 891555_893965
*PAR1:	I don't know . 895645_896125
*PAR0:	I can't even guess how many years of complete education I've gotten . 896725_899845
*PAR1:	years like . 900775_901365
*PAR1:	when is it ever complete . 901365_902525
*PAR0:	yeah . 902755_903045
*PAR0:	some of those years were . 903045_904045
*PAR1:	maybe . 904735_905085
*PAR0:	a little on the sketchy side . 905165_907405
*PAR1:	well I put down seventeen that . 908595_911245
*PAR0:	seems reasonable . 911245_912005
*PAR1:	I [/] I had kindergarten . 915325_917165
*PAR1:	and then I only had eleven instead of twelve . 917825_920845
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 921295_921645
*PAR1:	&-uh because I skipped a half grade . 922465_924885
*PAR1:	and yeah made up . 924985_925845
*PAR1:	and then &-uh four years of college . 926705_930045
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 930375_930725
*PAR1:	and then since college I've had several courses . 931025_933565
*PAR0:	yeah that altogether add up to a year . 934275_936565
*PAR1:	&-uh so it's not really complete but &-uh close . 937105_941725
*PAR0:	yeah . 942915_943205
*PAR0:	I just have such a mishmash . 943325_945205
*PAR0:	I'd have to go back and make little calendars to figure it out . 946025_949045
*PAR0:	and I'm not sure I even could . 949045_950365
*PAR1:	I don't think Richard ever could either . 950845_952725
*PAR0:	yeah I can say . 953915_954765
*PAR0:	okay . 954765_955045
*PAR0:	let's see . 955055_955485
*PAR0:	I took a semester at the University of Connecticut and then I took a semester at Mcgill in Montreal and I took three semesters at Northwestern in Chicago and then when I moved to California &-um I started doing bits and pieces different places . 955565_972925
*PAR0:	so there was one semester I was going to three different colleges . 973785_977165
*PAR0:	this is Monday I must go to . 977795_979525
*PAR1:	yeah . 980515_980805
*PAR0:	and there was one class that I took that was a half semester . 981585_986125
*PAR1:	class . 986775_987125
*PAR0:	so I got one and a half units of credit for it . 987985_990965
*PAR0:	but <it was> [/] it was at a time when the community colleges here had more money . 991345_995445
*PAR0:	and it was an English class that specialized in Lillian Hellman . 995985_1000085
*PAR1:	oh so I took . 1001145_1002405
*PAR0:	a half semester of just reading . 1002605_1004165
*PAR0:	Lillian Hellman . 1004235_1005085
*PAR1:	it was . 1006145_1006485
*PAR0:	wonderful . 1006485_1006805
*PAR0:	but the second half was Norman Mailer and I just wasn't as interested in that . 1006805_1009965
*PAR0:	so I didn't do . 1010065_1010805
*PAR1:	it . 1010805_1011005
*PAR1:	yeah . 1011355_1011645
*PAR0:	they had split it into two separate courses . 1012035_1013925
*PAR0:	so you could do one and not the other . 1014105_1016445
*PAR0:	and . 1018525_1018745
*PAR1:	&-uh . 1018805_1019025
*PAR0:	and then I [/] I took some courses at &-um El Camino College when I was working for Lorenzo And . 1020125_1026745
*PAR0:	I took the seminary courses at Samaritan for three years . 1027505_1031105
*PAR0:	I went to U S C for a while . 1032585_1034385
*PAR0:	and I just have a whole collection of things . 1034805_1037625
*PAR1:	do you still have a feeling that the University of Nebraska is your . 1040405_1045505
*PAR1:	yes . 1045805_1046025
*PAR0:	home . 1046375_1046665
*PAR1:	school . 1046765_1047185
*PAR1:	or are you getting that feeling . 1047925_1049465
*PAR1:	now about Pasadena . 1049645_1051065
*PAR0:	well I'm pretty well bonded to Pasadena but I always speak of when I went to the university . 1051495_1057505
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 1057565_1057905
*PAR0:	I forgot about the time I spent at Pc at &-uh Platte County which was also a p c C Pc Jc . 1057945_1064545
*PAR1:	mhm . 1065845_1066265
*PAR0:	yeah . 1067575_1067865
*PAR0:	&-um but I still when I speak of when I went to the university I always mean Nebraska yeah . 1068085_1075405
*PAR0:	even though I've been to plenty of other universities Nebraska's the one that I'm referring to . 1075405_1079365
*PAR1:	well but I think maybe having lived there in the dorm helped that didn't it . 1080835_1086525
*PAR0:	and that was my primary degree . 1086905_1088685
*PAR0:	I have &-um probably spent as much time at Pasadena as I spent at Nebraska let's see . 1090765_1100485
*PAR0:	well no not quite . 1102195_1103165
*PAR0:	but by the time I'm done it'll be pretty close . 1103945_1106085
*PAR0:	I will have I had the year and a half of prerequisites before I got into the nursing program . 1108005_1115125
*PAR0:	and I had taken classes in &-um two three separate semesters . 1116345_1123445
*PAR0:	but I only took one class each semester before that . 1123745_1127085
*PAR0:	and these were not consecutive semesters . 1127665_1129605
*PAR0:	they were spread out every three or four years . 1129605_1132845
*PAR0:	decide to take a class . 1132945_1133965
*PAR2:	mhm . 1135345_1135765
*PAR0:	and then the nursing program being two years that will be three and a half years of full-time &-uh without a break . 1136105_1143005
*PAR0:	study including summers which will be pretty close to how long I spent at the University of Nebraska . 1143335_1150085
*PAR2:	yep . 1152465_1152685
*PAR0:	I had &-um in the course of the &-uh five and a half years from when I started to when I graduated &-um I probably was out . 1154385_1173625
*PAR2:	three . 1176465_1176815
*PAR0:	semesters out of that . 1177535_1180215
*PAR0:	two when I went to &-um Platte College and one when I was just not in school at all . 1182195_1188535
*PAR2:	mhm . 1190525_1190945
*PAR0:	so it'll be close . 1193315_1194215
*PAR2:	put . 1198195_1198415
*PAR0:	it . 1198415_1198615
*PAR1:	all together . 1198615_1199055
*PAR1:	and it adds up to a lot of knowledge . 1199075_1201295
*PAR0:	yes . 1202915_1203135
*PAR0:	and it doesn't feel like redoing or duplicating . 1206005_1210145
*PAR0:	it feels like broadening a base . 1211885_1215665
*PAR0:	like maybe it was getting too skinny and pointy on the top . 1217985_1221395
*PAR0:	and I needed a little wider bottom . 1221535_1223435
*PAR0:	okay . 1223865_1224155
*PAR2:	mhm . 1225415_1225835
*PAR1:	which one's teachers in my area that went back to school . 1226485_1231315
*PAR0:	for two years . 1231495_1232315
*PAR1:	and he didn't go on to get his phd . 1233815_1236795
*PAR1:	he just got another master . 1237855_1239595
*PAR0:	in a different field . 1240575_1241435
*PAR1:	and a certification for &-uh another state . 1241655_1245755
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 1246285_1246635
*PAR1:	now it's still in the field of &-uh human . 1247305_1251085
*PAR1:	s . 1251685_1251805
*PAR0:	oh . 1252425_1252645
*PAR1:	but &-uh just a broader horizontal line . 1253185_1258565
*PAR0:	well I can see that [/] that makes sense to me . 1260855_1263025
*PAR0:	that's the kind of thing that I'm doing also with the things that I'm taking that are that I keep having pointed out to me . 1263025_1270465
*PAR0:	are not required . 1270485_1271665
*PAR0:	you don't have to take all that extra chemistry . 1272365_1274665
*PAR0:	and why are you trying to set it up so you can take physics and extra biology . 1274765_1279545
*PAR0:	you don't need those things . 1280085_1281025
*PAR1:	well he felt that &-uh if he got his phd that he might be overqualified for some of the jobs that he wanted to do . 1283015_1291825
*PAR0:	yeah . 1292255_1292545
*PAR1:	that they wouldn't want him &-uh there for fear he'd leave . 1293405_1298175
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 1298665_1299015
*PAR0:	and that happens . 1300475_1301255
*PAR0:	that's a pretty realistic fear . 1303715_1306055
*PAR1:	we went camping . 1313295_1314235
*PAR1:	yes . 1314695_1314915
*PAR1:	not go to Victoria Springs no . 1315015_1316955
*PAR1:	oh it was too darn hot . 1317135_1318915
*PAR1:	oh &-um the weekend . 1319255_1322715
*PAR1:	when we would've been at Victoria Springs it was &-uh part of that over a hundred . 1322785_1329635
*PAR0:	ten days of a hundred degrees . 1330295_1331475
*PAR1:	yeah . 1331865_1332155
*PAR1:	one of them was a hundred and six . 1332455_1333955
*PAR0:	so does that make it a thousand degrees . 1334775_1336315
*PAR1:	if you have ten . 1337615_1338155
*PAR0:	days of a hundred degrees . 1338155_1339115
*PAR0:	it makes it a thousand degrees . 1339135_1340355
*PAR0:	it felt . 1340775_1341235
*PAR1:	like . 1341235_1341515
*PAR1:	but the weekend before that we went out camping . 1343575_1346155
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 1346325_1346675
*PAR1:	to Mahoney State Park with Robinsons . 1346855_1349435
*PAR0:	with who . 1349905_1350435
*PAR1:	Robinsons uhhuh . 1351075_1351995
*PAR1:	Jack yeah . 1352185_1353035
*PAR1:	and Diane was &-uh with them for the first day of it . 1353735_1357675
*PAR1:	and then she went on to Minnesota for a high school reunion . 1358255_1362275
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 1363045_1363395
*PAR1:	but &-uh &-uh they had electricity in their rv . 1364255_1373485
*PAR1:	yeah . 1373515_1373805
*PAR1:	and they had to use it because of Jack's health . 1373825_1376365
*PAR1:	and so in order for us to be parked near them why we had to pay for it too . 1377385_1382525
*PAR0:	oh . 1383065_1383285
*PAR1:	thirteen dollars a night . 1384165_1386085
*PAR0:	that seems like too much for camping . 1386995_1388845
*PAR0:	but I know that that's not uncommon around here either . 1388865_1392805
*PAR1:	and we looked at their list of activities . 1393505_1395685
*PAR1:	and everything was at least four dollars per person for an hour or a half hour or something . 1395785_1402085
*PAR0:	in the camp . 1402985_1403445
*PAR0:	so . 1403505_1403725
*PAR1:	we decided not to go riding or play miniature golf . 1403725_1406845
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 1406845_1407165
*PAR1:	or go swimming . 1407305_1408045
*PAR0:	pull out a couple decks of cards . 1409795_1411365
*PAR0:	and . 1411625_1411845
*PAR1:	we did . 1412265_1412645
*PAR1:	yep . 1413025_1413245
*PAR1:	we played something called Balder Dash &-uh when Diane was still with us . 1414625_1419765
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 1419975_1420325
*PAR1:	and then &-uh after she left we put bridge . 1420945_1423965
*PAR0:	mhm . 1424265_1424685
*PAR0:	and sat around read books and took naps . 1426575_1429115
*PAR0:	and mhm sounds like a good vacation . 1429215_1431945
*PAR0:	yeah . 1432495_1432785
*PAR0:	Nicholas is getting to be one of those people who's tied to electricity . 1434985_1438025
*PAR0:	oh did I talk to you about the stuff we're doing around his asthma . 1439005_1442745
*PAR0:	well you said he had to go in for treatments at the hospital every so often . 1443495_1447705
*PAR0:	yeah he well he was when he first showed up with it he was hospitalized for a week . 1447735_1453585
*PAR0:	and he said . 1454365_1455025
*PAR0:	three emergency room visits since then . 1455025_1457305
*PAR0:	you said he had two in one day . 1457525_1459025
*PAR0:	yeah . 1459375_1459665
*PAR0:	and he's had &-um difficulty using the inhaler . 1460165_1467145
*PAR0:	it just doesn't seem like it does the job it's supposed to do . 1468245_1471145
*PAR0:	and they put him on two different kinds of inhale . 1471925_1474545
*PAR0:	and [/] and then a nasal inhaler . 1475085_1477465
*PAR0:	well one of those inhalers &-uh one of the inhaler ones that goes in the mouth is a steroid . 1478055_1483225
*PAR0:	and the one that goes in his nose causes sneezing fits . 1484245_1488025
*PAR0:	so there's a possibility that he's allergic to it . 1488125_1490785
*PAR0:	oh gee . 1491245_1491745
*PAR0:	and he was just having a horrible time and not able to sleep . 1493965_1498025
*PAR0:	yeah he'd wake up in a panic three or four times a night because he couldn't breathe . 1498935_1503905
*PAR0:	oh perfect . 1504365_1505345
*PAR0:	and &-um I [/] I knew I had the machine for giving the breathing treatments . 1506045_1512805
*PAR0:	but I didn't know where it was . 1513945_1515125
*PAR0:	so as we were getting ready to go on vacation I was tearing everything up to pack apart in my closets . 1516145_1522685
*PAR0:	which some of it had not been put back together since the earthquake . 1522685_1527605
*PAR0:	yeah I had some closet damage in the earthquake . 1527955_1530445
*PAR0:	and I just couldn't face going in there where everything had jumbled down on top of each other . 1530465_1535485
*PAR0:	yeah to dig through it . 1535795_1537365
*PAR0:	anyway I was looking for stuff for . 1538125_1539585
*PAR0:	vacation dug through and found the machine . 1539785_1541665
*PAR0:	and so I called Jenny and I said . 1542605_1543985
*PAR0:	okay come over here tonight . 1543985_1545185
*PAR0:	I'm gonna give you a lesson . 1545245_1546265
*PAR0:	and so she came over . 1547525_1549185
*PAR0:	and &-uh I started putting it together . 1549965_1551385
*PAR0:	well Nikki knew how to do it . 1551385_1552465
*PAR0:	he was very familiar with all this . 1554405_1555785
*PAR0:	this is what they do at the hospital . 1555905_1557265
*PAR0:	and he knew all about how this hooks to that . 1557405_1559385
*PAR0:	anyway so I gave her the little lesson . 1559925_1561545
*PAR0:	and &-um the medication that you use in it is the same stuff as what was in one of his inhalers . 1562285_1568665
*PAR0:	and so I was only sort of practicing medicine without a license . 1569645_1574905
*PAR0:	&-um and did the treatment for him which takes about fifteen minutes of [/] of &-uh it is like a personal vaporizer . 1576845_1586065
*PAR0:	yeah that it [/] it turns the medication into an inhalable vapor . 1586655_1591785
*PAR0:	and it just puts it up through a mask . 1592165_1594145
*PAR0:	and you just keep breathing until it's all gone . 1594245_1596705
*PAR0:	he went home that night . 1598365_1599265
*PAR0:	Jenny called me the next morning at about six thirty to say this is the first time he slept through the night in three months . 1599265_1605405
*PAR0:	oh great . 1606185_1607205
*PAR0:	and then apparently that wasn't the one he was allergic to . 1608185_1611725
*PAR0:	no . 1612265_1612485
*PAR0:	and then the &-um the night that Matthew got home they got home late from the airport . 1613225_1619565
*PAR0:	and [/] and she didn't do the breathing treatment . 1619865_1622525
*PAR0:	what I told her to do was every night just before he goes to bed do a breathing treatment . 1622525_1626965
*PAR0:	and that night they didn't because they came home late from the airport . 1628185_1631165
*PAR0:	well he was up three times that night just in a panic . 1631275_1635445
*PAR0:	and [/] and when he is panicked he can't use the inhaler correctly . 1635625_1641405
*PAR0:	he can't calm himself down to take the to get the timing right . 1642745_1647085
*PAR0:	and . 1647185_1647405
*PAR0:	take the deep breath that he needs to and hold it and all of that . 1647405_1651365
*PAR0:	it's kind of a &-uh sophisticated skill I guess . 1652315_1656045
*PAR0:	and when you're in a panic you can't do it . 1656185_1658125
*PAR0:	yeah . 1658275_1658565
*PAR0:	and &-uh I talked to her the next morning . 1659745_1662005
*PAR0:	&-um and by then I was in Atlanta but anyway I talked to her . 1663025_1665885
*PAR0:	and she said that if there was any doubt in her mind that the breathing treatments were what had helped with the problem that it was completely removed . 1666345_1676805
*PAR0:	you know she had thought . 1677585_1678605
*PAR0:	oh well maybe he's [/] he's better . 1678665_1681045
*PAR0:	now he's outgrowing it . 1681045_1682045
*PAR0:	maybe it's not such a [/] a problem . 1682045_1684605
*PAR0:	and that night convinced her that . 1685105_1687405
*PAR0:	well he really does need to do this without fail . 1688395_1692765
*PAR0:	and she said . 1694105_1694565
*PAR0:	you know it's [/] it's so much better for him because he has this one medical procedure that takes fifteen minutes . 1694565_1705365
*PAR0:	and he does it once a day . 1705665_1706885
*PAR0:	and you don't have her drive over the hospital all the time . 1707345_1710245
*PAR0:	well he was carrying around two inhalers in a waste pack all the time . 1710795_1716885
*PAR0:	he couldn't go to the park without having his inhalers with him . 1717545_1721445
*PAR0:	he couldn't rinse without having his inhalers go across the street to play with his friends and using them sometimes &-uh a couple of times in an hour when they're supposed to be four hours apart . 1721505_1732485
*PAR0:	and [/] and still having lots of these episodes of the panic setting in . 1733905_1740005
*PAR0:	and the heart rate goes up and the breathing changes and bad stuff . 1740065_1745845
*PAR0:	not good for you . 1746105_1746885
*PAR0:	overall . 1746915_1747405
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 1748025_1748405
*PAR0:	and so she says . 1748865_1750325
*PAR0:	now he doesn't even carry his inhalers with him because he doesn't need them . 1750385_1754045
*PAR0:	he hasn't since he's been doing the breathing treatments . 1754045_1756685
*PAR0:	they get it settled down enough that he can make it through . 1757515_1761165
*PAR0:	twenty four hours . 1761165_1761845
*PAR0:	okay . 1765315_1765605
*PAR0:	so now she has to figure out how to &-um explain it to the doctor that . 1765665_1770485
*PAR0:	&-uh thank you for your advice . 1770545_1772605
*PAR0:	however I took my sister's advice . 1772605_1774325
*PAR0:	and it worked better . 1774325_1775205
*PAR0:	so . 1775345_1775565
*PAR0:	yeah . 1778275_1778565
*PAR0:	now could you please prescribe what we need . 1778745_1780605
*PAR1:	is this &-uh medicine that goes in the inhaler . 1784785_1790235
*PAR1:	something that has to be prescription . 1790235_1792755
*PAR1:	yeah . 1793065_1793355
*PAR1:	it is a prescription thing . 1793355_1794675
