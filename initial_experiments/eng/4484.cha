*PAR0:	okay . 875_1165
*PAR0:	&-um I personally don't know a whole lot . 1185_3165
*PAR0:	I'm [/] I'm twenty one years old . 3345_4445
*PAR0:	and I don't have any children . 4445_5365
*PAR1:	you don't have any children yet . 5905_7045
*PAR0:	so but &-um I babysat and stuff . 7105_8925
*PAR0:	&-uh and I think about having children . 9185_10685
*PAR0:	so how about you . 11625_12525
*PAR1:	well I have three children . 13155_14485
*PAR1:	mhm and I've used various different kinds of daycare over the years . 14505_18885
*PAR1:	&-um I think actually the hardest time to find good daycare is when your baby's very young . 19425_27085
*PAR1:	oh really &-um because they can't tell you . 27505_31205
*PAR1:	mhm what's going on . 31425_32645
*PAR1:	the worst experience I had was when I was working when my &-um oldest child was a baby . 32945_39405
*PAR1:	mhm . 39745_40165
*PAR1:	and I thought . 40285_40805
*PAR1:	and I just I used a lady next door to me . 40905_43445
*PAR1:	and you know it was close by . 43785_45285
*PAR1:	and it was convenient . 45305_46205
*PAR1:	and he always came home clean and what have you . 46305_48445
*PAR1:	but I discovered that her way of handling conflicts between little kids . 49305_53205
*PAR1:	once they started crawling and stuff . 53275_55005
*PAR1:	mhm was very different from what I wanted . 55065_57765
*PAR1:	oh from my son she always interfered . 58185_60565
*PAR1:	and I understand that when you have a &-um you know when you have a bunch of kids and you have to make sure that they're all taken care of and everything else . 60565_69205
*PAR1:	you can't let things escalate . 69305_71845
*PAR1:	mhm . 71865_72285
*PAR1:	but she would deprive the environment in order for the kids not to fight . 72625_77485
*PAR1:	and then just stick them in front of the tv . 77545_79045
*PAR1:	oh wow . 79425_79845
*PAR1:	and I [/] I you know and I didn't discover that until later on . 79985_83845
*PAR1:	and by which time I decided to quit working anyway . 83905_86445
*PAR1:	but mhm I decided that actually that the hardest time to find good daycare is up to eighteen months old maybe from six weeks to six months you can do . 86465_94365
*PAR1:	but once your baby starts crawling and stuff from then until they really start talking . 94365_98045
*PAR1:	it's I [/] I find that's the hardest time to find the hard time . 98955_101685
*PAR0:	how old . 102105_102445
*PAR1:	are your children right now . 102445_104165
*PAR1:	they're seven five and three . 104165_105525
*PAR1:	oh wow . 105825_106285
*PAR1:	yeah that's nice . 106715_107645
*PAR1:	so but then once they're eighteen months old you can often find good preschool kinds of situations . 107865_114315
*PAR1:	mhm . 114315_114675
*PAR1:	but I think it's real important to check how you want social interactions handled . 114855_120395
*PAR1:	and how the school or daycare does it . 120775_124085
*PAR1:	mhm . 124145_124565
*PAR1:	you know and the other things to check they always tell you [/] you know . 124985_127365
*PAR1:	check to make sure that there's continuity of care . 127575_129885
*PAR1:	that your child is gonna have somebody that they can make an attachment to and stick with . 130075_135565
*PAR0:	right . 135935_136285
*PAR0:	what other kinds of things have you used . 136355_138085
*PAR0:	have you ever used like a daycare center type . 138085_140205
*PAR1:	well I used something sort of like a daycare center . 140435_143125
*PAR1:	&-um for my youngest one . 144065_145605
*PAR1:	when I went back to school last year . 145605_147085
*PAR1:	mhm . 147105_147525
*PAR1:	and it was something that was partially funded by the school . 149065_152605
*PAR1:	and it was at a y w c a oh . 152865_155125
*PAR0:	that's . 155125_155445
*PAR1:	nice . 155445_155605
*PAR1:	and that was pretty good . 156265_158365
*PAR1:	the biggest problem I had there actually was that they [/] they tried to provide continuity of care . 158385_164205
*PAR1:	but they kept changing the number of people that were in the program . 164345_167285
*PAR1:	you know people drop outta school . 167745_169085
*PAR1:	and so their kids would drop out of the program . 169105_170725
*PAR1:	and this and the other . 170945_171685
*PAR1:	and so and somebody would get sick . 172145_174525
*PAR1:	and they'd start shifting people around from one room to the next . 174545_177565
*PAR1:	and &-um that was really tough on my son because he'd made a real strong attachment with one particular caregiver . 178545_187605
*PAR1:	and then that one got switched out of his room . 187605_190405
*PAR1:	wow . 190905_191125
*PAR1:	but he [/] he adjusted to it pretty well . 191265_194125
*PAR1:	but that [/] that was tough on him . 194425_196125
*PAR1:	and they [/] they did their best not to do that . 196185_199285
*PAR1:	it's just that you know they kept having &-um because they were using students . 199315_207325
*PAR1:	mhm to provide the care . 207625_209205
*PAR1:	and because of the population of people who were using the care that became &-um much more of an issue with them . 209345_216125
*PAR1:	yeah . 217515_217805
*PAR1:	well so you would it sounds like the most important issue is the continuity of care . 218155_221605
*PAR1:	what do you mean when you say that in other words they should have the same person taking care of them . 221995_226765
*PAR1:	oh I see it makes sense . 227105_228405
*PAR1:	so the same space the same and see different people . 228405_231525
*PAR1:	even if a daycare center or a home or school or something has a philosophy as to how to deal with certain kinds of situations . 231555_241525
*PAR1:	mhm not every individual applies that philosophy in the same way . 241585_247205
*PAR1:	it makes sense . 247545_248125
*PAR1:	yeah . 248125_248405
*PAR1:	and so it's nice for kids to have a chance to get used to how things are going to happen . 248545_255845
*PAR1:	so that they [/] they have a chance they can start learning to predict . 256105_259605
*PAR1:	a little bit . 259685_260045
*PAR1:	mhm . 260045_260365
*PAR1:	I know real little ones don't do very much predicting . 260445_262885
*PAR1:	but they should have a chance to say . 262945_265045
*PAR1:	ah yes . 265505_266005
*PAR1:	okay . 266195_266485
*PAR1:	I'm gonna get there . 267025_267765
*PAR1:	and this is gonna happen . 267785_268725
*PAR1:	and this is gonna happen . 268825_269645
*PAR1:	and if I do this then that's gonna happen . 269865_273325
*PAR1:	you know they should have a way to be able to predict what's gonna happen to them . 273385_276565
*PAR1:	mhm . 276625_277045
*PAR1:	and &-um if you keep changing the people who are there then they have no nothing to hold onto . 277705_283965
*PAR1:	and it's hard enough on little ones to be away from the parents . 284705_288765
*PAR1:	mhm &-um yeah . 289025_291325
*PAR1:	and then different children too have different [/] different ways of handling it . 291405_295675
*PAR1:	one thing I think that parents really . 296135_298275
