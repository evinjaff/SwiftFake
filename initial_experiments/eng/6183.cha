*PAR0:	oh my goodness . 219345_220125
*PAR1:	I don't believe in what they're doing over there . 220285_221645
*PAR1:	I think it's wonderful . 221805_222605
*PAR1:	if the people would like to try to have peace with each other . 222605_225845
*PAR1:	but sure you know my father-in-laws told me all these stories about World War Ii and he said even the Nazis didn't like the Serbians they wouldn't get along . 225945_232725

*PAR0:	oh I know . 241105_241805
*PAR1:	I don't think our country should spend . 242045_243245
*PAR1:	what are they say . 243245_243885
*PAR1:	now six billion over there and . 243885_245445
*PAR0:	really . 245985_246405
*PAR1:	oh maybe it's just two billion . 247025_248445
*PAR1:	I get the billions confused with the number of landmines . 248525_250925
*PAR1:	and how much money we're gonna spend . 250925_252405
*PAR1:	but &-um I'll still be on a like a call up list if they need a dietician . 253305_257125

*PAR1:	water . 297895_298245
*PAR1:	okay . 298275_298565
*PAR1:	you said . 300265_300525
*PAR1:	don't let the playtime don't fit the children into your idea of play . 300525_303965
*PAR1:	they have more fun with just you know the boxes . 303965_305925
*PAR1:	and right . 306185_307485
*PAR1:	so really I've [/] I've been adjusting pretty well to all of this . 308185_311045
*PAR1:	but I tell you I don't know how people did it . 311105_312845
*PAR1:	years and years ago when they had like seven or eight of them and . 312845_315205
*PAR1:	oh . 315385_315605
*PAR0:	I had three at one time all at home you know clinging to my skirts . 315805_319805
*PAR0:	but I mean I enjoyed it . 319825_321485
*PAR0:	looking back on it . 321485_322285
*PAR0:	but it was very frustrating in a way . 322425_324885
*PAR0:	if there was anything else you wanted to do like even if you wanted to go into the library . 324885_329205
*PAR0:	say get a book it was very I had to dress three children . 329545_332885
*PAR0:	get the car you know . 333385_334405
*PAR1:	well you know too . 334795_335565
*PAR1:	my mom even has a friend that came to visit her that was part of a family . 335565_338725
*PAR1:	of . 338745_338965
*PAR1:	she said . 338965_339285
*PAR1:	either twenty or twenty one . 339285_340485
*PAR1:	I said . 340525_340765
*PAR1:	Mom you gotta be kidding . 340785_341685
*PAR1:	she said . 341685_342045
*PAR1:	no that honest to goodness . 342065_343765
*PAR1:	they had that many children back you know those years . 343835_346205
*PAR1:	and I said . 346225_346685
*PAR1:	how would you keep your mind . 346685_347845
*PAR1:	but I remember when I first met you though . 350185_351805
*PAR1:	and you were real positive about the whole thing . 351825_353685
*PAR1:	and I thought she wants to be a dietician . 353685_355645
*PAR1:	she's crazy . 355735_356325
*PAR1:	there's so many other things you could do . 356395_358165
*PAR1:	but I'm really glad you're in the administrative side now . 358545_360845
*PAR1:	because that's where the money is at . 361005_362045
*PAR1:	and you'll learn a lot more . 362145_363205
*PAR0:	I don't know about the money . 363845_364725
*PAR0:	end of it all that mean far as good . 364785_366685
*PAR0:	but I . 366685_367245
*PAR1:	know handling the budget . 367245_368485
*PAR1:	so knowing how much each portion is . 368625_370325
*PAR0:	it's a little more . 370715_371325
*PAR0:	yeah it's . 371515_372085
*PAR1:	a lot more analytical . 372085_373285
*PAR1:	yeah . 373915_374205
*PAR1:	I think hopefully dealing with the average person with their distress over what they're getting on their trays . 374405_380165
*PAR1:	I mean a lot of times you know even after I have a thing on ketogenic diet I mean to send to you too . 380205_384165
*PAR1:	and that but even after all these years that's pretty much what we were still doing . 384165_387325
*PAR1:	and that's why I decided the cash in my chips when I had Colleen because I thought . 388185_392085
*PAR1:	oh this is not gonna change . 392085_393125
*PAR1:	I can come back in ten years . 393245_394565
*PAR1:	it'll be the same thing . 394565_395445
*PAR1:	and she'll never be so cute again you know . 396905_398885
*PAR0:	oh I know I think you you'll this will be the happiest time with the children in my opinion . 399145_404805
*PAR0:	you know . 404825_405125
*PAR0:	and you'll look back and be very glad that . 405125_407245
*PAR1:	well it's really this damaged generation though . 407245_408685
*PAR1:	because like each day she learns something new . 408805_410365

*PAR1:	no . 854605_854805
*PAR1:	oh that's interesting . 854805_855565

*PAR0:	and &-uh well she must . 856605_857845
*PAR1:	well she must be desperate to make people miserable . 858035_859645
*PAR1:	why does she do these things . 859705_860845
*PAR1:	I don't know . 861325_861725
*PAR1:	talk about total quality management . 861835_863605
*PAR1:	and then it's this aggressive form of . 863625_865685
*PAR0:	that is exactly what Dylan said . 866075_867725
*PAR0:	oh of course now they're trying to appeal it . 867725_869445
*PAR0:	but &-uh well of course in the meantime she's had her hours changed . 869625_873125
*PAR0:	she comes in some days eleven to seven thirty . 873625_876525
*PAR1:	gonna know . 877295_877805
*PAR0:	for her . 878705_879005

*PAR1:	of course because &-um she has to at one time they parked in the Navy area there you know . 879785_884325
*PAR1:	and then commuted in . 884325_885165
*PAR1:	oh . 885165_885325
*PAR0:	yeah that's . 885325_885765
*PAR1:	a heck of a walk you know . 885765_887045
*PAR1:	oh it's . 887225_887765
*PAR0:	terrible . 888005_888165
*PAR0:	oh so I just I . 888545_889605
*PAR1:	don't know . 889605_889845

*PAR1:	here . 891395_891685
*PAR1:	this is better . 891685_892205
*PAR1:	Mama [/] Mama learning about the physical properties of these things . 892205_895245
*PAR1:	you know I didn't realize Jello could propel itself out of the . 895305_899365
*PAR1:	well I made it yesterday . 899395_900485
*PAR1:	well tell Phyllis that you know actually . 901915_904445
*PAR1:	&-um one positive thing about the government is that they [/] they really have to listen to two sides . 905065_911725
*PAR1:	they can't just do something like that willingly exactly . 911835_914285
*PAR1:	but those personnel people always changed hands too . 914345_917845
*PAR1:	and it was kind of hard to find who to talk to on there . 917865_920245
*PAR0:	yes . 920545_920765
*PAR0:	yeah . 920765_921045
*PAR0:	I think they will be going down to human resources either this week or early next week . 921445_925725
*PAR0:	just simply to lay it on the table . 925725_928325
*PAR0:	and to say . 928425_929005
*PAR0:	look we just don't feel that you know we are geared to do one particular thing . 929035_935325
*PAR0:	and we're willing to do certain other things . 935345_937245
*PAR0:	sure . 937355_937645
*PAR0:	but we don't think we should be demoted . 937785_939605
*PAR1:	oh course . 940345_940885
*PAR0:	demoted into another job while the patient suffers see . 940915_945525
*PAR1:	that's the . 946185_946645
*PAR0:	whole thing . 946645_946965
*PAR0:	the chief down there . 946965_947605
*PAR0:	no one is covering . 947785_948725
*PAR0:	there are four of them . 948855_949645
*PAR0:	you probably . 949825_950285
*PAR0:	I don't know . 950285_950645
*PAR0:	did you know a Janice there's a Janice in there now . 950665_953805
*PAR1:	and let's see . 953825_954885
*PAR1:	there's I knew Gloria the lady that was in the reserve . 954885_958565
*PAR1:	right . 958565_958885
*PAR0:	well &-um I think it affects Gloria Phyllis and two new dieticians . 959755_965325
*PAR0:	I can't think of their names who came from the Va in New Jersey they trained there . 965565_969805
*PAR0:	oh . 969985_970205
*PAR1:	yeah . 970205_970405
*PAR1:	East Orange in there . 970405_971365
*PAR1:	yeah . 971365_971565
*PAR1:	that's it . 971565_972085
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 972135_972485
*PAR0:	that's it . 972565_972805
*PAR0:	so they're kind of upset . 973185_974445
*PAR0:	because while they're down there no one is doing the floor work or . 974445_977845
*PAR1:	they're so . 977845_978205
*PAR1:	oh that's very dangerous . 978205_978885
*PAR0:	stressed out . 979125_979405
*PAR0:	and they have so many patients to cover for each other that it just isn't working . 979465_982965
*PAR1:	oh no . 983785_984245
*PAR1:	and . 984585_984805
*PAR0:	&-uh so they really are &-um they're upset about it . 984825_987845
*PAR0:	it's not that they don't want to work . 987845_989285
*PAR0:	it's just that they feel that this was an inappropriate solution to a problem that Marsha had which was people from the kitchen staff not coming into work . 989475_998285
*PAR0:	oh so . 998665_999125
*PAR1:	her . 999125_999285
*PAR0:	solution was to bring the dieticians in to . 999605_1001565
*PAR1:	cover &-uh just to have like warm bodies . 1001565_1003645
*PAR1:	it sounds like the military there . 1003785_1005205
*PAR1:	but you know you just can't do that . 1005345_1007165
*PAR1:	when you're working in the hospital you know . 1007275_1009005
*PAR0:	it's not fair to . 1009235_1009965
*PAR1:	the patient put it back in the bowl . 1009965_1011045
*PAR1:	put it back in the bowl . 1011265_1012125
*PAR1:	&-um I wondered is &-uh George's mother still living there with Phyllis too . 1012545_1016565
*PAR1:	because that was a real hard thing . 1016565_1017805
*PAR1:	she had . 1018145_1018405
*PAR0:	you know she died . 1018665_1019685
*PAR1:	did she pass on off there . 1020025_1021325
*PAR0:	she died . 1021345_1021725
*PAR0:	I'm trying to say in there . 1021905_1023525
*PAR0:	it might have been about a year ago . 1024025_1026045
*PAR1:	oh yeah . 1026345_1026765
*PAR1:	because I know that was so hard for Phyllis you know was hard . 1026965_1029165
*PAR1:	she was at that time working with the home care end of the Va too . 1029265_1033165
*PAR1:	and I remember she took me on some of her home visits to places that were really remarkable you know but really difficult . 1033225_1038165
*PAR1:	only somebody like Phyllis could have the background to . 1038235_1041085
*PAR0:	to handle [/] handle . 1041705_1042365
*PAR1:	that see through it all along . 1042365_1043485
*PAR1:	yes . 1043665_1043885
*PAR1:	sure . 1044155_1044445
*PAR1:	such a nice strong lady . 1044675_1046005
*PAR1:	wow . 1046185_1046405
*PAR1:	oh she is sometimes you don't realize the strength that you have until you have to go through something like that . 1046665_1051325
*PAR1:	but so true . 1051425_1052285
*PAR1:	yeah . 1052475_1052765
*PAR1:	his mother had like this buzzer or something . 1053305_1055165
*PAR1:	and sometimes when you would be talking with her the buzzer would go off . 1055225_1058005
*PAR1:	and she'd . 1058105_1058565
*PAR1:	oh just a minute I have to go check on her . 1058625_1060245
*PAR1:	and I guess it was like she was in a different room . 1060305_1062045
*PAR1:	but that's kind of how she could communicate . 1062145_1064405
*PAR1:	and I thought . 1064405_1064845
*PAR1:	bless her heart . 1064845_1065525
*PAR1:	boy she really is . 1065665_1066485
*PAR1:	oh . 1066745_1066965
*PAR0:	she [/] she . 1067065_1067605
*PAR1:	did a saint to put up with that . 1067665_1069240
*PAR1:	yeah . 1069835_1070125
*PAR0:	well listen Janet maybe I'm taking up too much of your time here . 1070155_1073445
*PAR1:	no . 1073445_1073645
*PAR1:	no . 1073645_1073765
*PAR1:	we have the bath water . 1073765_1074645
*PAR1:	I'll run . 1074675_1075085
*PAR1:	this is fun . 1075085_1075645
*PAR1:	it's kind of like . 1075755_1076405
*PAR1:	I can't believe I'm really talking to you . 1076685_1078125
*PAR1:	because I thought it's been too long . 1078405_1079685
*PAR1:	you know it really go over . 1079865_1081005
*PAR0:	to children's . 1081025_1081765
*PAR0:	every now and then it's [/] it's very different over there . 1081765_1084125
*PAR0:	you know they have . 1084265_1084965
*PAR1:	oh sure . 1085385_1085805
*PAR0:	a food service company in there . 1086245_1088085
*PAR0:	now I think Marriott if I'm not mistaken . 1088145_1090445
*PAR1:	oh right . 1090745_1091045
*PAR1:	they've been there a while . 1091195_1092005
*PAR0:	changed the cafeteria around . 1092005_1093725
*PAR0:	it's all very different . 1093835_1094845
*PAR0:	but it's still nice you know . 1094905_1096645
*PAR0:	and they have a big patient population . 1096645_1098605
*PAR0:	in fact last week my son's sister-in-law my son's wife's sister had a little baby that needed &-uh intestinal surgery . 1098665_1109725
*PAR0:	aw at the age of about six months . 1110145_1112565
*PAR0:	and they did it at Chop aw . 1112785_1114405
*PAR0:	so they [/] they just are geared up to do the most wonderful things there you . 1114905_1119405
*PAR1:	know . 1119405_1119485
*PAR1:	oh sure . 1119485_1119805
*PAR0:	you can fault in the baby's doing well . 1119825_1121925
*PAR0:	and . 1122665_1122885
*PAR1:	I think even in Omaha they have at Children's hospitals . 1123245_1125525
*PAR1:	I'm not mistaken . 1125585_1126245
*PAR1:	oh do they . 1126305_1126765
*PAR1:	but of all the ones in the country there's nothing like that . 1126865_1129165
*PAR1:	I've never I haven't seen them all . 1129475_1132045
*PAR1:	but I know in the readings . 1132065_1133605
*PAR1:	and sometimes you'll see things on tv . 1133605_1135165
*PAR1:	and it's always Children's Hospital in Philadelphia you know . 1135225_1137965
*PAR0:	right . 1138055_1138405
*PAR0:	they do a lot of research and everything . 1138435_1140445
*PAR0:	how far are you from Omaha John . 1140785_1142885
*PAR1:	oh we're far . 1143265_1143925
*PAR0:	are . 1144705_1144925
*PAR1:	you in fact &-um from the Chicago airport up here to Saginaw I had to take a &-um an army course down in Chicago earlier before I this Bosnia thing was even mentioned . 1144925_1155525
*PAR1:	you know anyway to make a long story short there was a lady from Paris France that had just gotten kind of lost you o Air O'hare Airport and you know I'm not really totally afraid of strangers . 1155545_1164205
*PAR1:	and I could tell she was having some trouble . 1164205_1165645
*PAR1:	so I said . 1165785_1166245
*PAR1:	can I help you find your gate . 1166245_1167405
*PAR1:	and we walked down through the United area where they have all the pretty &-um lights and everything . 1167825_1172685
*PAR1:	and of course you know my French was about as bad as her English but she was going to Grand Island Nebraska because her oh I think it was her daughter and her son-in-law or maybe her son and daughter-in-law forget exactly . 1172685_1183285
*PAR1:	but she didn't know how to use the phone or anything . 1183425_1185085
*PAR1:	and I thought . 1185105_1185525
*PAR1:	well I'll help you out here . 1185525_1187245
*PAR1:	but yeah it was another &-um I think she said another two hours or so on a flight out to Grand Island from Chicago so I think from Saginaw down to &-uh Omaha would be . 1187305_1195805
*PAR1:	oh you know you get on that turnpike down there by Toledo the Ohio Turnpike could you it'd be another good long day's trip I think . 1196385_1202365
*PAR0:	would it another dab . 1202365_1203405
*PAR1:	now Ken my husband . 1203705_1204365

*PAR0:	oh my goodness . 1212825_1213605
