*PAR0:	so it's not it's a nice plus the side effect . 139945_142285
*PAR0:	but . 142345_142565
*PAR0:	mhm . 142665_143085

*PAR0:	okay . 162325_162565
*PAR1:	and it's [/] it's really difficult to try to figure out what you're gonna do . 162985_166525
*PAR1:	because you fall right smack dab in middle class . 166765_169005
*PAR0:	right [/] right . 169575_170285
*PAR1:	and you get zapped the most of just about everybody . 170305_172885

*PAR0:	not kidding . 177385_177645
*PAR0:	you're doing it too . 177785_178485
*PAR0:	so you [/] you were pulling in two incomes that probably sticks you right in the middle too . 178625_181845
*PAR0:	yeah . 182155_182445
*PAR0:	with three kids . 182555_183285
*PAR1:	well most of the &-um you know the tax stuff is under the table . 183955_187805
*PAR0:	oh there you go there . 188505_190045
*PAR1:	you go . 190045_190245
*PAR1:	that's the only way you can make anything . 190245_191605
*PAR0:	no . 192065_192285
*PAR0:	you've just been recorded saying that I know . 192285_194245
*PAR0:	yeah . 197435_197725
*PAR0:	I do a little under the table on the side myself on stuff mostly vehicle work . 197765_202085
*PAR0:	but . 202185_202405
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 202495_202845
*PAR0:	yeah that's stuff that tax free stuff is nice unofficial tax free stuff . 202915_207205
*PAR1:	right . 207495_207845
*PAR1:	&-uh that's the only way to go . 208145_209765
*PAR1:	otherwise you can't make it . 209765_210845
*PAR1:	that's right . 210845_211325
*PAR1:	I don't know . 211445_211765
*PAR1:	they've gotta come up with something . 211765_212765
*PAR1:	and hit some of the big companies and lower it on the middle class . 212765_216125
*PAR0:	yeah . 216675_216965
*PAR0:	well that's [/] that's the thing . 216965_218125
*PAR0:	&-uh there there's they've hit . 218225_220785
*PAR0:	it's . 221175_221465
*PAR0:	funny that they went with the I guess the Reaganomics called for a trickle down theory . 221465_225865
*PAR0:	I think that's pretty [/] pretty much &-uh disproven at this point right . 226065_230145
*PAR0:	they've gone this many years . 231055_232185
*PAR0:	it's pretty much trashed . 232255_233785
*PAR0:	mhm . 233965_234385
*PAR0:	&-uh if from what I see &-uh . 234765_237585
*PAR1:	yeah . 237775_238065
*PAR1:	they've gotta come up with something new and different . 238065_239665
*PAR0:	well have you seen the division of wealth figures lately . 239665_242785
*PAR0:	something like the top one percent have the top some ungodly . 243215_248105
*PAR0:	or the top one percent have forty percent or the top ten percent have forty percent of the wealth . 248105_252265
*PAR0:	mhm . 252765_253185
*PAR0:	and like the top one percent have like twenty five percent or something . 254005_257505
*PAR0:	right . 257875_258225
*PAR0:	and it's just getting worse with this tax structure . 258565_261545
*PAR0:	mhm . 261845_262265
*PAR0:	so . 262845_263065
*PAR1:	that's exactly it . 263885_264905
*PAR1:	well it's just the same as the new tax codes that just came out . 264905_267665
*PAR1:	if you make over a hundred and seventy five thousand right a year . 267665_271185
*PAR1:	you're limited on your &-um what you can get back you know as far as taking off for your deductions . 271185_275865
*PAR0:	right . 275875_276225
*PAR1:	and I said . 276605_277145
*PAR1:	who in God's name makes that much money . 277145_279065
*PAR1:	the . 279325_279545
*PAR0:	top one percent . 279545_280305
*PAR1:	that's about it . 280805_281665
*PAR0:	yeah . 281815_282105
*PAR0:	they always cry . 282375_283065
*PAR0:	they always cry that &-um you know that well you know if you tax the rich more you're actually not getting that much money . 283065_289105
*PAR0:	because there aren't that many of them . 289865_290825
*PAR0:	whereas you're getting a lot of money from [/] from the &-uh from all the middle class . 290825_296265
*PAR0:	because even though you're taking less from each one there's so many more . 296265_298945
