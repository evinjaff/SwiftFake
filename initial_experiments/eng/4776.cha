*PAR1:	well everyone's that way . 204755_205845
*PAR1:	I [/] I &-uh you know was encouraged a lot when I was younger to do sports . 205965_209325
*PAR1:	and I just hated every one of them . 209385_211005
*PAR0:	I didn't like the competitiveness of them but I enjoyed playing around with the sports that didn't . 213325_218765
*PAR0:	mhm . 218765_218965
*PAR0:	you know I enjoyed the sport itself . 219065_220765

*PAR1:	uhhuh . 234775_235125
*PAR1:	he was competitive . 235225_236085
*PAR1:	but he toned it down when we were going out and playing . 236085_238325
*PAR1:	and so it was more of a challenge to myself . 238665_240805
*PAR1:	you know a golfer is mainly trying to get your score down . 240865_243645
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 243895_244245

*PAR0:	but I think he's the competitive type . 256085_259745
*PAR0:	I'd rather just stick with walking . 260685_262705
*PAR0:	and sometimes I like to go you know a neighbor friend of mine goes once in a while with me . 262925_267825
