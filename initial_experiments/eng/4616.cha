*PAR1:	oh I've &-um put a deposit on it . 34605_37305
*PAR1:	I went over to buy it . 37665_38545
*PAR1:	and the man didn't have a title . 38685_39905
*PAR1:	mhm and come to find out what had happened . 40445_42865
*PAR1:	he has &-um &-uh he's Lebanese he's been living over here for he what he's Lebanese and he is been in America for eighteen years . 42965_49905
*PAR1:	oh mhm and &-um what has ended up happening . 50005_54465
*PAR1:	it's turned out to be quite an answer to prayer because number one I needed a car . 54465_58985
*PAR1:	and I &-uh had looked at a number of cheaper cars . 59845_63425
*PAR1:	mhm . 64125_64545
*PAR1:	and through prayer you know the thing that came to me was to pray for what I wanted . 64685_68865
*PAR1:	well I you know I still didn't want to spend a lot of money and so on . 69375_71785
*PAR1:	but I did want to Volvo I did want to seven forty . 71785_73945
*PAR1:	&-um and if not a seven forty an eighty six or newer . 75485_78745
*PAR1:	oh so that's what I prayed for . 79645_81185
*PAR1:	mhm either a two forty that was eighty six or newer or I would take &-um I'd taken an eighty five seven forty . 81405_87785
*PAR1:	mhm . 88525_88945
*PAR1:	so what I ended up finding was an eighty seven [/] seven forty . 89165_92625
*PAR1:	oh that needs work . 93165_94185
*PAR1:	mhm and &-uh I looked it up in the book . 94565_98185
*PAR1:	it made need a head gasket . 98205_99545
*PAR1:	and I looked it up to see if that was a job I felt like doing . 99965_102545
*PAR1:	and &-uh it'll be the biggest job I've ever done on a car . 103165_106305
*PAR1:	but I think I'll go ahead and give it a try . 106305_107745
*PAR1:	mhm and &-um but the bottom line is you may remember my mentioning some while back that I was preaching in Alaska &-uh back in January right . 108045_118225
*PAR1:	and &-uh making a long story short . 119125_121145
*PAR1:	through the course of that service I began to feel like I needed to &-uh be engaged in outreach among some of the Arabic people here in &-uh the Detroit area . 121145_132225
*PAR1:	and haven't known how to start and have been praying for contacts with Arabic people . 132225_135865
*PAR1:	well through looking for this car . 137415_138705
*PAR1:	I've got it . 138735_139305
*PAR2:	ah-ha . 139835_140185
*PAR1:	what ended up happening is . 140855_142265
*PAR1:	&-um I went over to get the Vin number Sunday night so that I could get my insurance by phone you know on [/] on Monday morning . 142325_149145
*PAR1:	and then go over and get the car and bring it home . 149165_151105
*PAR1:	and &-uh while we were talking I said . 152565_154585
*PAR1:	what country are you from . 154585_155505
*PAR1:	he said . 155565_155905
*PAR1:	Lebanon and &-uh so I said to him . 155905_159705
*PAR1:	I said . 160785_161105
*PAR1:	&-uh people like you are what make America great . 161325_164105
*PAR1:	the immigrants . 164205_164865
*PAR1:	mhm . 165205_165625
*PAR1:	and &-uh . 165965_166625
*PAR2:	that's an interesting observation . 167125_168625
*PAR1:	<he said> [/] he said that in eighteen years of living here no one had ever said that to him that all he'd heard was . 168885_174625
*PAR1:	you guys come over here . 174645_175585
*PAR1:	you take all our money . 175585_176465
*PAR1:	he says . 177605_178025
*PAR1:	yeah . 178025_178225
*PAR1:	he says we take money . 178325_179365
*PAR1:	he says . 179745_180165
*PAR1:	we take them in the jobs where we're working . 180165_181765
*PAR1:	he says . 182145_182525
*PAR1:	just like anyone else who works . 182525_183845
*PAR1:	mhm . 184065_184485
*PAR1:	so there's been a lot of hostility in Detroit toward the Arabic people . 185185_188485
*PAR1:	and &-um &-uh so in any case through that remark what happened is when I went over there on Monday he said he was very embarrassed . 189465_199025
*PAR1:	he didn't have the title . 199025_199865
*PAR1:	and what has happened is he's been running a collision shop . 200925_203745
*PAR1:	so about a month ago he had gone over to an auction to buy a car for his wife . 203805_207305
*PAR1:	and he had bought this Volvo and then &-uh it had a mechanical problem . 208125_213185
*PAR1:	he didn't even want to try to mess with it . 213245_214985
*PAR1:	it one mechanic said . 215325_216705
*PAR1:	it's the head gasket . 216705_217545
*PAR1:	one said it is the thermostat . 217545_219225
*PAR1:	mhm . 219565_219985
*PAR1:	and he said . 220325_220985
*PAR1:	if it's just the thermostat then I'm getting a car that needs almost no work for twenty five hundred . 220985_225545
*PAR1:	but the bottom line is he's selling it to me basically for what he's got in it . 225685_228985
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 229315_229665
*PAR1:	and &-uh it's just something . 229965_230945
*PAR1:	he doesn't wanna work on the car . 230945_232025
*PAR1:	right . 232355_232705
*PAR1:	and &-uh &-uh so [/] so that's what's happened . 233085_237145
*PAR1:	but meanwhile the title is tied up in Lansing . 237145_239385
*PAR2:	oh . 239925_240145
*PAR1:	because it's a theft recovery . 240415_241945
*PAR1:	mhm . 242325_242745
*PAR1:	so &-um the insurance company had auctioned it . 243045_245625
*PAR1:	you know . 245625_245825
*PAR1:	and he's been driving it for a month . 245825_247265
*PAR1:	but &-um you know to register it as one thing . 247845_249905
*PAR1:	but to have the title in your hand is another . 249905_251665
*PAR1:	so &-um he said that it [/] it could be as much as two more weeks before he gets it . 252965_257625
*PAR2:	mhm . 258205_258625
*PAR1:	or it could arrive in the mail today . 259125_260745
*PAR2:	yeah . 261375_261665
*PAR1:	but meanwhile &-uh he was so embarrassed about that whole thing . 262565_265625
*PAR1:	he had me in I had coffee with him . 265625_267185
*PAR1:	&-uh I asked him where to buy pine nuts . 267645_270425
*PAR1:	we've been to a few of the Arabic restaurants here in town . 270475_272905
*PAR1:	and Debbie's taking a liking to pine nuts . 272905_274745
*PAR1:	so his wife ended up giving us a big bag of pine nuts . 275525_278105
*PAR2:	oh . 278765_278985
*PAR1:	and &-uh you know plus we know where to get them now . 279925_283505
*PAR1:	yes . 283925_284145
*PAR1:	plus they want to get together . 284255_285345
*PAR1:	and &-um I'll have dinner together . 285405_286905
*PAR1:	yeah . 287415_287705
*PAR1:	and &-uh he seems to be a Muslim though he was talking more like a Hindu hmm . 288205_293625
*PAR1:	he said . 293725_294105
*PAR1:	all roads lead to the same god . 294105_295545
*PAR1:	yeah . 295935_296225
*PAR1:	classic Hinduism . 297415_298545
*PAR2:	yeah . 299135_299425
*PAR1:	so in any case it's [/] it's &-uh turned out to be not just one but two answers to prayer . 300565_304705
*PAR1:	hmm you know with a bit of a delay thrown in . 305385_307265
*PAR1:	but right . 307285_307825
*PAR1:	&-uh I'm not real anxious about that . 308125_310465
*PAR1:	frankly by the time I get the car probably the heat wave will break . 312175_314905
*PAR1:	and it won't be so bad . 314925_315865
*PAR1:	working on it . 315865_316465
*PAR1:	yeah . 316815_317105
*PAR2:	and &-uh well now will you check out the thermostat first . 317725_320625
*PAR1:	oh yeah . 320965_321385
*PAR1:	mhm . 321565_321985
*PAR2:	and &-uh so prayerfully that will be <all it> [/] all it needs . 322845_326985
*PAR1:	well if it does need a head gasket . 327895_329585
*PAR1:	it's &-um I [/] I looked it up in the Volvo and it looks like Volvo is probably one of the easiest cars there is to change a head . 329615_337145
*PAR2:	gasket on . 337165_337665
*PAR2:	alright . 337665_337825
*PAR2:	did I bring my torsion wrench up to you . 337825_339825
*PAR1:	yeah . 340255_340545
*PAR1:	okay . 340975_341265
*PAR1:	yeah . 341415_341705
*PAR1:	but I'm gonna have to get a get one that's better . 341705_343705
*PAR1:	calibrate it . 344025_344385
*PAR2:	oh . 345445_345665
*PAR1:	because I'm &-um it's [/] it's just something where &-um they [/] they make a kind where you set a dial . 345745_354415
*PAR1:	and it clicks and so on . 354435_355655
*PAR1:	oh I'm gonna have to do that [/] that because I've got to have real precision . 355995_358605
*PAR2:	maybe you can trade off for it then . 358775_360445
*PAR1:	well . 361575_361865
*PAR2:	trade a trade . 361865_363505
*PAR2:	the one I brought up &-uh into the dial one . 363505_366265
*PAR1:	I don't know how you know . 367305_368185
*PAR1:	I mean . 368225_368465
*PAR2:	yeah . 368895_369185
*PAR1:	I've never heard of trading tools . 370335_371425
*PAR1:	but . 371605_371825
*PAR1:	yeah . 371935_372225
*PAR1:	well you know unless it was with a [/] a person . 372455_375025
*PAR1:	but . 375485_375705
*PAR1:	mhm . 375765_376185
*PAR1:	but &-um yeah the other one is fine for things like setting the wheel bearings and that kind of thing . 377245_383225
*PAR1:	mhm . 383225_383585
*PAR1:	but &-um I'm [/] I'm gonna have to have real precision on the head . 384005_388785
*PAR1:	but the way I look at it is if I'm buying a four to five thousand dollars car for twenty five hundred . 389685_395305
*PAR1:	and I have to go out and spend forty dollars on a wrench . 395365_397625
*PAR1:	I'm not really gonna worry about it . 397685_398865
*PAR1:	yeah . 399055_399345
*PAR2:	and &-um now &-um then now remember we a couple of times we went well one time I think or maybe twice to this Lebanese restaurant . 400085_411705
*PAR2:	mhm . 412285_412705
*PAR2:	is there any connection there . 413405_414745
*PAR1:	&-uh not really . 416365_417265
*PAR2:	mhm . 417725_418145
*PAR1:	I'm not sure which one we went to . 420205_421625
*PAR1:	but &-uh oh . 421725_422465
*PAR2:	well we went to the same one . 422935_424385
*PAR2:	yeah . 424615_424905
*PAR2:	and &-uh all I can remember is it was on a busy wide street . 425525_429585
*PAR2:	mhm . 429805_430225
*PAR2:	and &-uh of course there are a lot of busy wide streets in Detroit . 431445_435425
*PAR1:	there's one every mile . 435425_436505
*PAR1:	yeah . 436535_436825
*PAR1:	yeah . 437175_437465
*PAR2:	and &-uh so well that [/] that sounds interesting . 438365_443655
*PAR2:	sounds like you've got &-uh &-um got another good deal <in the> [/] in the making . 443655_448895
*PAR2:	yep . 449275_449495
*PAR2:	and &-um . 450275_451015
*PAR1:	and if that title doesn't work out then I [/] I can you know I've got all the information I need where I can collect my deposit back . 451195_457095
*PAR1:	but . 457155_457375
*PAR1:	mhm . 457375_457775
*PAR1:	&-um if it doesn't work out the friendship may be more important than the car anyway . 457875_462415
*PAR2:	yeah . 462925_463215
*PAR2:	mhm . 463275_463695
*PAR2:	well I [/] I imagine it's all going to &-um work out for the good . 465165_469655
*PAR2:	what whichever way it goes . 469685_471095
*PAR2:	then . 471095_471375
*PAR2:	mhm . 471475_471895
*PAR2:	and &-um so well &-um I guess &-um I've been reading the message . 472395_479215
*PAR1:	yeah . 481915_482205
*PAR2:	and &-um I went through &-um Matthew and marked zip [/] zip . 482625_488725
*PAR2:	and then somewhere about the middle of Luke all of a sudden one evening after I was reading it before I went to bed . 489425_496765
*PAR2:	and &-uh I thought . 497465_498645
*PAR2:	now wait a minute slow down . 498645_499965
*PAR2:	and &-um so I did . 500745_502325
*PAR2:	and I slowed down and John and &-uh then and through acts &-um it helped a lot in acts . 502345_510205
*PAR2:	it cleared up . 510225_511085
*PAR2:	I think a lot of the &-um &-um well I kind of for several years I've had this feeling in acts that it was more travel log than [/] than &-uh anything &-uh you know of substance . 511765_527205
*PAR2:	mhm . 527345_527765
*PAR2:	but this &-uh I realized &-uh that I had missed it . 527845_531005
*PAR2:	and &-um so anyway I I'm well into Romans yep . 531665_535725
*PAR2:	and &-uh so &-uh he has a way of presenting things which it does make it clear and some &-um although I thought I had a pretty good handle on John A but I got through with John A I thought . 535905_553085
*PAR2:	well what was he talking about . 554315_555805
*PAR2:	so I thought I decided . 556705_558685
*PAR2:	no I'll go ahead and read the rest of the New Testament then I'll go back and pick up Johnny yeah . 558785_564405
*PAR2:	and &-uh try it again . 564825_566045
*PAR2:	and &-um read it both in the N k J V and [/] and the message . 566825_572085
*PAR2:	and between the two I'll come out all right . 572305_574565
*PAR2:	mhm but I [/] I think what surprised me was I thought I didn't realize there was this much theology in John E . 574585_582565
*PAR1:	yeah . 583915_584205
*PAR1:	there's an awful lot there . 584205_585205
*PAR2:	and &-uh this is one of those . 585625_586845
*PAR2:	&-um it kinda can equal in [/] in a way it can equal John Seventeen and &-um maybe even surpass it . 587465_597485
*PAR2:	although I think those two chapters are have a different focus . 598285_601965
*PAR2:	mhm . 603265_603685
*PAR2:	go in different directions . 603785_604845
*PAR2:	oh yeah they [/] they do they're parallel . 605185_606845
*PAR2:	you might say . 606905_607405
*PAR2:	and &-um then &-um but it's &-um &-uh I like <what I> [/] what I read in Romans it's &-um &-um Romans is a rough book to begin with . 608265_623215
*PAR2:	it's [/] it's some of the sin material there to chew on . 623325_626775
*PAR2:	yeah . 626965_627255
*PAR2:	with his presentation it's &-um &-uh well it's a difference in chewing on roast beef and chewing on &-um &-uh what [/] what would be a stringy &-um on the stringy legs out of a stringy strands out of a chicken light or something where you chew . 627965_649615
*PAR2:	<and two and> [/] two and nothing happens . 649615_650975
*PAR2:	well the . 651645_652095
*PAR1:	King James is very [/] very accurate . 652095_654135
*PAR1:	yeah in a word for word sort of way . 654645_656455
*PAR1:	but the syntax in something like Romans Five is almost impossible . 656455_659655
*PAR2:	mhm . 660035_660455
*PAR2:	and &-um it's . 661755_663615
*PAR1:	funny . 663615_663655
*PAR1:	it seems like a lot of the things that are right at the heart of the New Covenant they garble it in the King James they garble it with accuracy . 663655_670095
*PAR1:	if I can say it like that . 670275_671335
*PAR1:	mhm . 671555_671975
*PAR1:	they [/] they do [/] do it word for word very well . 672365_674975
*PAR1:	but &-um it [/] it comes together in such a jumble . 675075_679335
*PAR1:	and it's almost unreadable . 679915_681135
*PAR1:	mhm . 681355_681775
*PAR2:	and &-uh so I don't really basically I don't worry because I say . 683205_687745
*PAR2:	okay . 687815_688105
*PAR2:	it seems sort of cloudy to me . 688485_690065
*PAR2:	today next week next month . 690065_692465
*PAR2:	oh yeah I missed it . 693045_695305
*PAR2:	I made too much . 695865_696625
*PAR2:	&-uh I made it &-uh too difficult for me . 697125_699225
*PAR2:	and I got in my own way . 700285_701545
*PAR2:	and I'm good at doing that . 702725_704105
*PAR1:	well in John eight the above and beneath business <is the> [/] is the heart of it . 704335_709105
*PAR2:	mhm . 709485_709905
*PAR1:	from above and from [/] from beneath . 710855_712745
*PAR1:	and that's also the &-uh theme of chapter three . 713545_716165
*PAR2:	yeah . 716915_717205
*PAR1:	the done really [/] really centers on that . 718985_720725
*PAR1:	and &-um I believe that in doing that it gives us a real link between policy theology and what Jesus preached about the Kingdom of God because the kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven us from above . 721585_733605
*PAR2:	right . 734175_734525
*PAR2:	okay . 736625_736915
*PAR2:	so &-um but I &-um I've caught on to one thing . 738715_744015
*PAR2:	I'll pick up the message . 744965_746135
*PAR2:	and said . 746195_746615
*PAR2:	well I'll read a chapter . 746615_747575
*PAR2:	and &-uh three chapters later . 748355_750215
*PAR2:	oh . 750435_750655
*PAR1:	yeah . 751525_751815
*PAR2:	I'm supposed to I've got to leave for work . 752355_754655
*PAR2:	now you know that's the &-uh the only thing I &-uh I'll start reading . 754755_760375
*PAR2:	and I &-um read more than I &-um more than the time I [/] I thought . 760435_767015
*PAR2:	okay . 767205_767495
*PAR2:	I've got ten minutes . 767495_768255
*PAR2:	&-um and I I've read for fifteen before I realize I've passed ten minutes . 768915_774175
*PAR2:	yeah . 774365_774655
*PAR2:	and that's good . 774655_775295
*PAR2:	and &-uh ready to do that and plow through it . 777035_780655
*PAR1:	yeah that's true . 781925_782695
*PAR2:	and &-uh so &-um but I sure is that available . 783315_791255
*PAR2:	&-um I [/] I know you ordered it from this place in or Massachusetts is it available in bookstores . 792475_800135
*PAR1:	as far as I know it is . 800555_801615
*PAR1:	mhm . 802035_802455
*PAR1:	Christian Book Distributors just has good prices . 802535_804895
*PAR1:	mhm . 805595_806015
*PAR1:	and &-um they generally have everything marked down anywhere from a little bit to a lot . 806195_811575
*PAR2:	yeah . 812205_812495
*PAR2:	and &-uh they sent me a catalog . 813685_814905
*PAR2:	and I thought a lot of books I'd sure like to get . 815045_818585
*PAR2:	yeah . 818695_818985
*PAR2:	and then and the price reductions I got [/] got &-uh bought to the last two or three pages . 819405_826585
*PAR2:	I thought . 827465_827745
*PAR2:	now it's funny . 827745_828305
*PAR2:	the books I want are the ones I've marked down fifty to seventy [/] seventy five percent . 828645_833265
*PAR2:	yeah . 833575_833865
*PAR2:	so does that say something about my taste in books . 834205_836985
*PAR1:	not really . 838205_838665
*PAR1:	I think what it says is &-uh how long the book's been on the market . 838825_841585
*PAR2:	oh . 842525_842745
*PAR1:	well because a lot of times the newest books &-uh you know it's that old supply and demand thing . 843375_848185
*PAR1:	mhm . 848445_848865
*PAR1:	and it hasn't gotten to where there's any kind of glut of supply yet . 849805_852865
*PAR1:	oh it's still in the process of distributing the book . 853645_856145
*PAR1:	whereas when it when it's been on the market for a while &-uh I've [/] I've found some of John Wimber's stuff . 856255_862425
*PAR1:	mhm . 863085_863505
*PAR1:	which &-uh a few years ago you know would've sold for top dollar . 863585_867435
*PAR1:	but now they've got it marked down quite a bit . 867455_869195
*PAR2:	mhm . 869535_869955
*PAR2:	and &-uh so well maybe yeah I'll have to take consider that too out . 871575_876995
*PAR2:	this must say something about my [/] my taste or something that I'm off in one corner or something . 877385_884435
*PAR2:	but yeah you're right about the . 884535_886635
*PAR2:	I hadn't thought about the . 886795_887835
*PAR2:	well . 888025_888315
*PAR1:	a lot of the books they have marked way down are classics . 888315_890795
*PAR2:	mhm . 891545_891965
*PAR2:	and &-uh so . 893825_895805
*PAR1:	and they always have a [/] a good price on things like strong concordance . 896785_900245
*PAR1:	mhm . 900245_900565
*PAR1:	some of the pretty standard reference works . 900645_902165
*PAR2:	yeah . 902595_902885
*PAR2:	and &-uh so I still think one of the best buys I ever bought was when I do remember in Atlanta &-uh there was a place up &-uh just off of Bufort Highway and I bought Strong's complete Concordance for four dollars and eighty five cents . 903825_921965
*PAR1:	oh yeah [/] yeah that's and . 922105_923445
*PAR2:	I think that's one of the best buys in that book I've ever made . 923445_926005
*PAR2:	mhm . 926545_926965
*PAR2:	and it's still &-um think isn't blurred . 927345_930765
*PAR2:	it's still just as I've used it a lot . 930835_933725
*PAR2:	and it's held up very well . 934345_935605
*PAR2:	of course I'm easy on books . 935605_936725
*PAR2:	anyway . 936745_937165
*PAR2:	yeah . 937395_937685
*PAR2:	and &-uh so and I figured that has to be one of the best buys I've ever made . 938105_943085
*PAR2:	mhm . 943505_943925
*PAR1:	and &-uh oh boy . 944065_945565
*PAR1:	I'm reaping one of the grand rewards of old age . 945625_948005
*PAR1:	fuck . 948675_948965
*PAR1:	just has a friend that's got a Triumph &-uh t R seven . 948995_952365
*PAR1:	I just sent them out to do an errand for me . 952605_954565
*PAR1:	yeah . 954835_955125
*PAR1:	and they came back . 955425_956325
*PAR1:	so &-uh I've got the parts for the car . 956465_959525
*PAR1:	I'm gonna beef up the suspension before I drive to New York tomorrow . 959585_962005
*PAR2:	oh well you're going to Pinecrest . 962665_965285
*PAR1:	yeah . 965515_965805
*PAR1:	yeah . 966435_966725
*PAR1:	mhm . 966725_967045
*PAR1:	and &-uh speaking at a reunion . 967225_968645
*PAR1:	then I'll be at &-uh the church . 968675_970285
*PAR1:	Bob Lake is pastoring Sunday morning . 970385_972085
*PAR1:	yeah . 972235_972525
*PAR2:	<and &-uh> [/] and &-uh did Bob is Bob at Pine Pinecrest now . 973665_978245
*PAR1:	&-uh he's been there but the he's been pastoring the church there . 978865_981965
*PAR1:	and what has happened is there's been &-um I guess the church has kind of split off from school . 982025_987845
*PAR1:	oh . 988545_988765
*PAR1:	and &-uh Bob did everything he could to keep the split from being in any way ugly or . 989025_993565
*PAR1:	mhm . 993565_993885
*PAR1:	anything . 994405_994485
*PAR1:	but it's [/] it's just I'm afraid gotten kind of out of hand . 994665_998645
*PAR1:	yeah . 999115_999405
*PAR1:	and &-um . 999825_1000325
*PAR2:	Split's usually do well . 1001915_1003925
*PAR2:	now he's not in Atlanta . 1003925_1006005
*PAR1:	no . 1006785_1007005
*PAR1:	he's [/] he's living in &-uh I think in Little Falls . 1007075_1009405
*PAR2:	okay . 1010235_1010525
*PAR2:	and Tom's still in Bulgaria . 1011265_1013045
*PAR1:	&-uh Tom is in Syracuse . 1013465_1014765
*PAR2:	oh . 1015425_1015645
*PAR1:	mhm . 1016105_1016525
*PAR1:	yeah Bulgaria just didn't pan out for him to live there . 1016605_1018765
*PAR1:	now he just came back from a trip there . 1019305_1021285
*PAR1:	and it's &-uh one of those remarkable stories of [/] of &-uh divine appointment . 1021425_1026365
*PAR1:	hmm . 1026965_1027045
*PAR1:	he was planning at first to go with &-uh Dr Ford who's a teacher at Pinecrest they were gonna go to Bulgaria together . 1028465_1034845
*PAR1:	they've been there before . 1034845_1035645
*PAR1:	and &-uh there's a little town &-uh a little church over in Do Bridge I say little . 1037185_1041125
*PAR1:	it's about three hundred people . 1041125_1042325
*PAR1:	mhm . 1042585_1043005
*PAR1:	so it's &-um I guess kinda large for my circle of fellowship . 1043085_1046925
*PAR1:	but in any case &-uh do bridge is over toward the &-uh let's see . 1048065_1052765
*PAR1:	it'd be the eastern end of Bulgaria City used to be called Toll Buen and when &-um at some point I think right after the second World War or maybe between the first and Second World War it would've been the &-um Romanians owned that part of Bulgaria oh . 1052765_1069165
*PAR1:	so in any case &-uh Tom has been to this church over there in Dores quite a number of times . 1070465_1076525
*PAR1:	so he and Dr Ford were gonna go to Bul area . 1077665_1079925
*PAR1:	and then they were gonna go on to a bible school in Russia one of the Pinecrest graduates had started . 1080625_1086445
*PAR1:	and it's running . 1086865_1087605
*PAR1:	mhm well making a long story short . 1088545_1091445
*PAR1:	&-uh it didn't pan out to go to Russia Tom hadn't felt like god was dealing with him to go to Russia anyway so the bottom line was &-uh he canceled that trip . 1091825_1102485
*PAR1:	he completely changed his plans . 1102545_1104125
*PAR1:	someone had given him a prophecy about changing his plans . 1104475_1107125
*PAR1:	and &-uh next thing you know &-uh Russia fell through . 1108105_1111005
*PAR1:	so he changed his plans . 1111025_1112165
*PAR1:	and he went with Bill Pepper now Bill Pepper is a contemporary of Wade Taylor so . 1112865_1117805
*PAR1:	he is probably twenty years younger . 1117825_1119325
*PAR1:	oh mhm but he and Wade were in bible school together . 1119505_1122245
*PAR1:	mhm and Bill has an Apostolic ministry . 1122785_1124965
*PAR1:	he started &-um started about a dozen churches in Peru and &-uh raised up leaders . 1125025_1131685
*PAR1:	and [/] and &-uh then he moved to Alaska oh so in any case Bill was going to a &-um &-uh some kind of a minister's conference a pastor's conference in the Czech Republic so the deal was that Tom would meet him there . 1131825_1145165
*PAR1:	and then they would go to Dorich together . 1145185_1147125
*PAR1:	mhm . 1147505_1147925
*PAR1:	so they went to the Czech Republic Tom had a real good time . 1149065_1151645
*PAR1:	there . 1151645_1151885
*PAR1:	feels like he'll probably return there next time he goes to Eastern Europe then they went down to &-um Bulgaria and they had to kill a day in . 1151895_1161445
*PAR1:	so Sophia they arrived in the morning their train left . 1161545_1164565
*PAR1:	&-uh I think it leaves at like eight or nine at night . 1164785_1167085
*PAR1:	and you're on the train overnight . 1167625_1168885
*PAR1:	you wake up at six in the morning . 1168885_1170085
*PAR1:	you're in Do bridge . 1170085_1170845
*PAR1:	hmm . 1171405_1171485
*PAR1:	so &-um they had time to kill . 1172025_1174685
*PAR1:	and they were out in some open air market . 1174685_1176085
*PAR1:	and a woman came up to them said . 1176085_1177725
*PAR1:	are you American Tom says . 1177725_1179245
*PAR1:	yes I am he didn't think much of that because he and Bill were speaking English to each other . 1179245_1184165
*PAR1:	she says . 1185505_1186005
*PAR1:	&-um have are you in the ministry . 1186105_1189005
*PAR1:	he says . 1189065_1189445
*PAR1:	yes I am she says . 1189445_1190725
*PAR1:	have you preached with Dr Ford and solicitor . 1190755_1194245
*PAR1:	and he said . 1195305_1195725
*PAR1:	yes I have by now he's perking up really interested . 1195725_1198365
*PAR1:	she says . 1198385_1198765
*PAR1:	it's your name Tom yes it's so what it came down to was there was a &-um there was a pastor from Ra which is right on the board of Romania basically . 1198845_1211925
*PAR1:	and this pastor is &-um looking to . 1212465_1215245
*PAR1:	do some open air meetings in villages . 1215245_1217165
*PAR1:	now it's illegal right now . 1218185_1219725
*PAR1:	just to go into a town and have an open air Gospel meeting in Bulgaria &-uh but if the city officials ask for it then of course you can do it . 1219725_1228525
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 1228815_1229165
*PAR1:	so in other words they have the liberty to ask . 1229265_1231045
*PAR1:	and then if they ask then you have the liberty to do it . 1231265_1233725
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 1234215_1234565
*PAR1:	so this pastor &-uh who's also an evangelist has gotten invitations from a number of villages . 1235385_1241165
*PAR1:	but his biggest problem was money . 1241865_1243525
*PAR1:	&-uh so again what ended up happening . 1244505_1247365
*PAR1:	Tom had some extra money to give to the Bulgarian people when he was there it had been donated for that purpose . 1247825_1253445
*PAR1:	and it seems that it costs about a hundred dollars per crusade . 1254665_1257525
*PAR1:	most of the expense being the &-um transportation for the people who participate in the crusade for the equipment and so on . 1257995_1265725
*PAR1:	mhm . 1265725_1265965
*PAR1:	Va system that kind of thing . 1266105_1267365
*PAR1:	I think they have to hire taxis or something . 1268045_1270005
*PAR1:	&-uh because of all the equipment they have to carry over there musical instruments and that sort of thing . 1270425_1275565
*PAR1:	so anyway it's about a hundred dollars a piece . 1276385_1278165
*PAR1:	so Tom gave them five hundred dollars . 1278745_1280245
*PAR1:	and they are now gonna be working like killing snakes in order to have five of these meetings before the elections in October it's possible that if the elections bring in a new government that there'll be a complete change of policy . 1280905_1294565
*PAR1:	mhm . 1295475_1295895
*PAR1:	and they may or may not be able to continue with these open air meetings . 1296075_1299175
*PAR1:	yeah . 1300445_1300735
*PAR1:	so in any case they then &-um from that contact they went on to Dobro when they got to Dobro the &-uh pastor was still the pastor . 1301035_1310895
*PAR1:	but he had decided he would not take a salary . 1311075_1312895
*PAR1:	anymore . 1312925_1313415
*PAR1:	and he started selling ice cream &-uh just <as a> [/] as a street vendor . 1313755_1317735
*PAR1:	hmm . 1318335_1318415
*PAR1:	well what's happening there is . 1319805_1321295
*PAR1:	he's now spending more time with the people in his church than he was before . 1321485_1324735
*PAR1:	because in communist countries they have usually fantastically good &-uh &-uh public transit systems . 1325605_1333575
*PAR1:	mhm . 1333995_1334415
*PAR1:	and &-uh of course part of the reason for that is that the economy doesn't support everyone having their own car . 1334795_1339775
*PAR1:	oh so [/] so they have these marvelous public transportation systems . 1340555_1344695
*PAR1:	and the downtown in Do Bridge is [/] is &-uh really if they did something like this here in the States <it would> [/] it would go over . 1345395_1351495
*PAR1:	great . 1351495_1351735
*PAR1:	it's like a big open air mall . 1351805_1353295
*PAR1:	oh and I bet it's half a mile long some places . 1354035_1356935
*PAR1:	it's probably a quarter of a mile deep . 1357085_1358695
*PAR1:	geez several blocks deep . 1358885_1360255
*PAR1:	mhm and it's pedestrians only . 1360835_1362615
*PAR1:	hmm . 1364215_1364335
*PAR1:	so of course the traffic can drive up to this thing . 1364835_1367375
*PAR1:	and I think there are a couple alleys where trucks can come back through there &-uh to you know to service the shops and whatnot . 1367375_1373535
*PAR1:	right . 1373825_1374175
*PAR1:	but when all is said and done the [/] the bulk of this thing is pedestrian . 1374515_1378095
*PAR1:	hmm . 1378895_1378975
*PAR1:	and &-uh so that's where Miko has been selling his ice . 1379435_1383615
*PAR1:	cream . 1383615_1383855
*PAR1:	and in the course of the day probably most of the church will end up in that mall for one reason or another . 1384555_1390015
*PAR1:	so he's seeing more of the people as an ice cream salesman than he was as a pastor . 1391395_1394855
*PAR1:	he's probably making more money too . 1396325_1397735
*PAR1:	and they don't even realize it . 1398515_1399695
*PAR1:	you know what I mean it's [/] it's a weird situation . 1399915_1402655
*PAR1:	yeah it's an interesting turn of events . 1402725_1404655
*PAR1:	then all the elders in the church had resigned not because they were disgruntled and wanted to leave but because . 1404925_1412015
*PAR1:	they felt that they were not bearing the fruit they needed to be bearing in ministry . 1412015_1416735
*PAR1:	and they felt that it was just an act of submission to turn in their &-uh well to resign . 1417515_1422655
*PAR1:	and if god wanted them to continue that he would somehow speak . 1423235_1426205
*PAR1:	so what ended up happening is Bill Pepper having an Apostolic ministry . 1427625_1431245
*PAR1:	having started &-uh literally dozens of churches . 1431245_1434125
*PAR1:	and having been sort of a &-um &-uh fatherly figure with a number of other people who have started churches . 1434945_1441245
*PAR1:	Bill has a pretty strong idea of what works and what doesn't . 1442075_1444845
*PAR1:	mhm . 1445985_1446405
*PAR1:	and &-um so he didn't just try to dictate to them what they ought to do . 1446945_1451445
*PAR1:	he just started asking questions . 1451545_1453125
*PAR2:	oh . 1454185_1454405
*PAR1:	and by the time his few days there were over &-um he'd asked some leading questions . 1454785_1459765
*PAR1:	the various minister ministers there in the church had prayed about it . 1460025_1464845
*PAR1:	and by the time he left the elders were back on board . 1465745_1468445
*PAR1:	&-uh the pastor is now thinking of himself as a pastor again . 1468865_1471925
*PAR1:	the &-um &-uh church is excited moving forward . 1472465_1475725
*PAR1:	the elders now have new responsibilities that they didn't have before . 1475725_1478845
*PAR1:	and &-um so it [/] it was just a tremendous visitation of God for that particular church . 1481185_1487525
*PAR1:	mhm . 1487745_1488165
*PAR1:	because it gave him a new sense of direction and purpose . 1488245_1490445
*PAR1:	and &-uh I [/] I guess the way Bill handled it was that he didn't think of himself as being someone called in just to tell him what to do . 1491785_1499245
*PAR1:	but it was more a matter of kind of awakening the talents that were already there in the people . 1499745_1504325
*PAR1:	so &-uh it was just a fluke that Tom went with Bill Pepper they never expected to get there and find the church ready to reorganize . 1506985_1514205
*PAR1:	&-uh but it [/] it that's how the trip went . 1515545_1518285
*PAR2:	mhm . 1518825_1519245
*PAR2:	<sort of> [/] sort of like &-um acts all over in the twentieth century . 1522115_1526925
*PAR2:	yeah . 1527195_1527485
*PAR1:	mhm . 1527485_1527885
*PAR2:	and &-um the way things just happen here and there . 1528305_1531285
*PAR2:	and now when you go when you leave tomorrow for New York how long will you be gone . 1532265_1537805
*PAR1:	I'm gonna be coming home Sunday night . 1538785_1540365
*PAR2:	oh it . 1540905_1541445
*PAR1:	just I've got two men from the church going with me . 1541445_1543365
*PAR1:	and one of them has to be back for work on Monday mhm . 1543365_1545845
*PAR2:	yeah . 1547115_1547405
*PAR2:	you're going to take the white volvo . 1547745_1549205
*PAR1:	no . 1549985_1550205
*PAR1:	we sold that one . 1550205_1550925
*PAR1:	oh . 1551465_1551685
*PAR1:	so we've got a &-um a green one . 1553025_1555405
*PAR1:	mhm . 1555665_1556085
*PAR1:	and &-um I kind of bought it the same way . 1556705_1558765
*PAR1:	I'm buying this Seven forty . 1558785_1560005
*PAR1:	mhm . 1560465_1560885
*PAR1:	&-um it's funny . 1561145_1564305
*PAR1:	you know you [/] you were mentioning John eight that from above and from beneath business . 1564325_1568425
*PAR1:	it [/] it seems to be really at the heart of things . 1569005_1570705
*PAR1:	hmm . 1571665_1571745
*PAR1:	&-um you know I prayed for this [/] this particular car that I'm buying . 1572245_1576945
*PAR1:	and the thing that came to me was ask for what you want . 1576965_1579345
*PAR1:	now the important thing is not just &-um what was said but the important thing is that there was some kind of an answer from above . 1581485_1588865
*PAR2:	mhm . 1589445_1589865
*PAR1:	you know what I mean . 1590805_1591345
*PAR1:	in other words <you could> [/] you could make a doctrine out of that . 1591405_1593585
*PAR1:	but the doctrine would be from beneath . 1593605_1595265
*PAR1:	you see it'd just be man thinking . 1596445_1597945
*PAR2:	yes . 1598525_1598745
*PAR1:	but when god reveals it's from above . 1598965_1600905
*PAR2:	mhm . 1601685_1602105
*PAR1:	now the last time I needed a car it was the same sort of thing . 1602725_1605325
*PAR1:	I [/] I &-uh prayed about a car . 1605485_1608165
*PAR1:	I didn't know where to look . 1608245_1609085
*PAR1:	but we had a man in the church who was &-uh not especially deep in his commitment to the lord . 1609105_1615885
*PAR1:	mhm . 1616145_1616565
*PAR1:	and his wife was right on the brink of leaving him &-um to had the feeling that he was perhaps getting involved with some other women . 1616645_1624445
*PAR1:	&-uh he was kind of a macho type from Kentucky oh yeah . 1625625_1629325
*PAR1:	and &-uh so he [/] he felt you know she would say . 1629465_1632605
*PAR1:	where have you been . 1632605_1633245
*PAR1:	you said you'd be home at six . 1633305_1634525
*PAR1:	here it is nine thirty . 1634525_1635485
*PAR1:	his attitude would be . 1636385_1637365
*PAR1:	I don't have to tell you where I've been . 1637405_1638885
*PAR1:	oh yeah you know it was like . 1639985_1641285
*PAR1:	and [/] and for [/] for all anybody knows he was under a car the whole time . 1641705_1645125
*PAR1:	mhm . 1645185_1645605
*PAR1:	but the point is just the idea of telling his wife where he'd been bothered him . 1645685_1648765
*PAR1:	oh yeah made him feel like less of a man . 1648905_1650645
*PAR1:	mhm . 1650985_1651405
*PAR1:	so in any case &-um I prayed for a car a year ago . 1651905_1655765
*PAR1:	and the thing that came to me was go to an auction with Jeff okay . 1656385_1661565
*PAR1:	now that one line was from above . 1661565_1663205
*PAR1:	yeah . 1663755_1664045
*PAR1:	so Jeff and I went to an auction . 1664225_1665725
*PAR1:	I didn't find a car . 1666405_1667285
*PAR1:	but what happened is I did spend three or four hours with Jeff ah . 1667745_1671325
*PAR1:	well he ended up saying that God really blessed him because in the process of the whole deal he ended up buying ten cars that day . 1671915_1678885
*PAR1:	hmm . 1679325_1679405
*PAR1:	and of course that's his business buying and selling these cars . 1679825_1682325
*PAR1:	oh mhm so he bought ten of them . 1682785_1684565
*PAR1:	and he said that he said . 1685185_1686565
*PAR1:	boy he says . 1686565_1687125
*PAR1:	God was really with you . 1687145_1688005
*PAR1:	he says after he says right after you left he says . 1688065_1690485
*PAR1:	I bought ten cars . 1690485_1691205
*PAR1:	ah . 1691905_1692125
*PAR1:	but of course I didn't find what I was looking for . 1693105_1695085
*PAR1:	oh . 1695465_1695685
*PAR1:	but in the process of looking for it he knew what I was looking for . 1696065_1699005
*PAR1:	and so about a month later he says . 1699065_1701325
*PAR1:	I found a volvo . 1701365_1702045
*PAR1:	oh . 1703305_1703525
*PAR1:	so I went out to the &-um junkyard where he'd found it . 1703545_1706365
*PAR1:	it was a theft recovery . 1706365_1707565
*PAR1:	mhm . 1707985_1708405
*PAR1:	and the one he'd found &-uh it really was a beauty . 1708485_1711645
*PAR1:	it was a seven forty . 1711645_1712685
*PAR1:	and it was missing a lot of expensive parts . 1713825_1716325
*PAR1:	and &-uh it would've been a lot of work to restore it . 1716985_1719925
*PAR1:	but I would've got in a car with I think sixty thousand miles on it . 1720425_1724405
*PAR1:	mhm &-uh probably for two or three thousand . 1724825_1727965
*PAR1:	mhm . 1728225_1728645
*PAR1:	and &-uh I'd have ended up coming out probably three thousand dollars ahead . 1728945_1734405
*PAR1:	but I'd have had more money in it than I wanted to spend right then . 1734405_1736885
*PAR1:	oh mhm . 1737185_1737765
*PAR1:	plus I didn't have the time . 1737845_1738845
*PAR1:	but right behind it was a green two forty . 1739585_1741685
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 1742575_1742925
*PAR1:	I said . 1743205_1743485
*PAR1:	well what about that one . 1743485_1744245
*PAR1:	I said that one there looks like what I could handle it was missing its front seat . 1744325_1748525
*PAR1:	huh . 1749185_1749405
*PAR1:	one of them was there but it wasn't anchored down . 1749665_1751645
*PAR1:	&-uh a window had been removed . 1752465_1753965
*PAR1:	the radio was out . 1754265_1755325
*PAR1:	&-um there were a few pieces of trim scattered around on the interior . 1755865_1759325
*PAR1:	mhm . 1759985_1760405
*PAR1:	and &-um so anyway I bought that car . 1760945_1764205
*PAR1:	and they [/] they didn't have any keys for it . 1764205_1765685
*PAR1:	so they dropped the as in price from fifteen hundred to thirteen fifty . 1765685_1768925
*PAR1:	oh well after I got home and realized I'd bought the car I thought you know I've never ever heard this thing run . 1769625_1775125
*PAR1:	who knows if it even runs but . 1775145_1778605
*PAR1:	the point is you know that the thing I'd gotten from above was go to an auction with Jeff hmm . 1778825_1785445
*PAR1:	and all I'd done is I'd just followed the thread of events that occurred after going to the auction with Jeff hmm . 1785865_1791485
*PAR1:	well meanwhile it seems like that time spent with Jeff was time well spent because &-um God began to work . 1792195_1799635
