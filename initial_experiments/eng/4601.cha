*PAR1:	&-uh one of my favorite &-uh backpacking stories is &-uh when my wife and I took a trip from Crested Butte up over the hill into Aspen and what we had done is we had sent some Civvies or &-uh civilian clothes so to speak &-um on a head to a hotel in Aspen and &-uh we backpacked over the mountains . 133985_156885
*PAR1:	took us &-uh three days or so . 157555_159045

*PAR1:	and rode around Aspen on the bike . 166025_167965

*PAR1:	sounds good . 223905_224565
*PAR0:	&-uh unfortunately my backpacking experience has not been as good recently mainly because &-uh the type of camping I've been doing has been with the Boy Scouts and Boy Scout backpacking is a far cry . 224705_237645
