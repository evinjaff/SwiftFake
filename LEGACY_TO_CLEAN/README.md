# LEGACY_TO_CLEAN

This folder contains a backup of all of the code. It is not very organized, because I was still writing a lot of the code days before my defense (as Master's students typically do). I also had to give my MacBook back to the University a few days after the defense, so I bulk comitted my entire folder in case I missed anything when doing my dump.


I am planning to eventually clean up this folder for better organization, but for now, I will quickly annotate what is in each of the folders to give a slightly better idea of each one.

- LLMExperiments: All of the code that tests the secret space mechanism.
- audiottsserver: Webserver by Ching-Hsiang to run a real-time calling server via WebRTC. It was kind of working, but had to be scrapped for time
- offline: largely tinkering
- offline_compare: evaluation of the models against testing spam calls

All of the other files and folders are either smaller scratch experimetns or individual scripts that have their name clearly labeled
